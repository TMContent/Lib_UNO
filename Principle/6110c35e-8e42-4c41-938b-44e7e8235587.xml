  <p>Disable end-user accounts or write events to a log after a set number of failed logon attempts. If you are using Windows authentication, such as NTLM or the Kerberos protocol, these policies can be configured and applied automatically by the operating system. With Forms authentication, these policies are the responsibility of the application and must be incorporated into the application design.</p>
  <p>Be careful that account lockout policies cannot be abused in denial of service attacks. For example, well known default service accounts such as <i>IUSR_MACHINENAME </i>should be replaced by custom account names to prevent an attacker who obtains the Internet Information Services (IIS) Web server name from locking out this critical account.</p>]]></Data>
