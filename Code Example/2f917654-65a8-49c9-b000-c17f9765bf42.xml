## Code Examples ##

There are 2 basic ways to perform input validation within Struts1: manually within an action or using the validator mechanism. (There is an annotations validation mechanism, but that has been deprecated and will not be supported in the future, and thus is not discussed further here.)

No matter which mechanism you choose, you'll want to make sure validation is enabled at the struts framework level. In order to do that, you'll want to make sure the interceptor stack that is configured to handle requests includes both the "validation" and "workflow" interceptors. These are enabled by default in the struts-default interceptor stack, but if you customize your stack, you'll want to ensure you include them. An example snippet from a custom interceptor stack is below.

~~~~
<interceptor-stack name="myCustomStack">
   ... // all other interceptors
   <interceptor-ref name="validation">
      <param name="excludeMethods">input,back,cancel,browse</param>
   </interceptor-ref>
   <interceptor-ref name="workflow">
      <param name="excludeMethods">input,back,cancel,browse</param>
   </interceptor-ref>
</interceptor-stack>
~~~~

**1. Manual validation overriding the validate() method.**

If you extend the ActionSupport class for your actions, you can simply override the validate method within your class and have the framework call this method in order to perform validation. Below is an example of a simple validation regarding the login action.

~~~~
public class LoginAction extends ActionSupport {
    ...
    public void validate() {
        if (getUserName().length() == 0) {
            addFieldError("userName", "User Name is required");
        if (getPassword().length() == 0) {
            addFieldError("password", "Password is required");
        }
    }
    ...
}
~~~~


**2. Using the validator framework.**

Using the Struts validator framework involves using additional files. There is 1 file (validators.xml) that is included once for the entire application, then a set of action specific files, generally one per action (or one per action/alias). These files have the naming convention ActionName-validation.xml (ex. LoginAction-validation.xml)

Since the validators.xml file covers many standard validations, to get started you'll only need to create action specific configuration files to specify the types of validations you want for your given action. An exmaple for the login action is given below.

~~~~
<validators>
  <field name="uname">
      <field-validator type="required">
          <message>You must enter a value for user name.</message>
      </field-validator>
  </field>
  <field name="pw">
      <field-validator type="required">
          <message>You must enter a value for password.</message>
      </field-validator>
  </field>
</validators>
~~~~

Now that the validations are in place, you should have an associated action class, JSP and Struts configuration configured.

A sample action class is below:

~~~~
public class QuizAction extends ActionSupport {
    private String uname;
    private String pw;
    public String getUName() {
        return uname;
    }
    public void setUName(String uname) {
        this.uname = uname;
    }
    public String getPw() {
        return pw;
    }
    public void setPw(String pw) {
        this.pw = pw;
    }
}
~~~~

The JSP might include a form that looks something like this:

~~~~
<s:form method="post">
    <s:textfield label="User Name: " name="uname"/>
    <s:textfield label="Password: " name="pw"/>
    <s:submit/>
</s:form>
~~~~

Finally, the associated Struts configuration might look like this:

~~~~
<action name="HelloWorld" class="tutorial.HelloWorld">
    <result name="success">/home.jsp</result>
    <result name="error">/error.jsp</result>
    <result name="input">/login.jsp</result>
</action>
~~~~

It's important to note that the input result should be included, since that is where the user will be routed in the case that the validation fails. This should be the same location that triggered the validation. For example, from our login.jsp the user is routed to the action, the validation fails, and then the user is re-routed back to the same login.jsp so there is a smooth experience for the user.
