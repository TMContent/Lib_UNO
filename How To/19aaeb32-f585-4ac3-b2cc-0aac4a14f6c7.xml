    <span>Summary</span>
  </h1>
  <p>
    <span>Many web applications use session management to track visitors&#8217; authentication state.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, e-commerce sites issue a session to a client in order to verify that the client is logged in, and to display their personal information.<span>&nbsp; </span>An attacker&#8217;s goal during session hijacking is to steal the victim&#8217;s session and masquerade themselves as that victim.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>By masquerading as the victim the attacker can use the vulnerable site as though they are the victim, impersonating them.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the case of banking sites, the attacker could read the victim&#8217;s balance and potentially make transactions on their behalf.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the case of webmail sites, the attacker could potentially read and write emails as if they were the victim.<span>&nbsp; </span>Attacks due to session hijacking vulnerabilities are extremely dangerous.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>When talking about session hijacking there are two victims:</span>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <span>The <i>vulnerable web application</i> that allows the attacker to steal a session using methods presented here.</span>
      <li>
        <span>The <i>Internet client</i> that gets <i>hijacked</i> due to their session being stolen.</span>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <span>Although the Internet client victim is most affected, the actual vulnerability exists in the server application.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>
  </p>

  <h1>
    <span>Step 1:<span>&nbsp; </span>Understand Attack Scenarios</span>
  </h1>
  <p>
    <span>The first step in testing for session hijacking is to have a solid understanding of how the attack itself is executed.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>A prerequisite in any session hijacking attack is to identify both the vulnerable web application and select an Internet client victim.<span>&nbsp; </span>For these attacks to work the client victim needs to be an active user of the vulnerable web application.<span>&nbsp; </span>A good example is an online banking website with session-related vulnerabilities.<span>&nbsp; </span>Active users of the system can be found by a variety of methods, of which phishing is the most popular.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>There are three common session-hijacking scenarios:</span>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span>Hijacking a session via cross-site-scripting.</span>
      <li>
        <span>Predicting a session.</span>
        <li>
          <span>Session fixation.</span>
        </li>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
    <span>Hijacking sessions using cross-site scripting (XSS)</span>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <span>The most common scenario of session hijacking is due to cross site scripting (XSS) bugs.<span>&nbsp; </span>These bugs are fairly common and quite easy to exploit.<span>&nbsp; </span>If an attacker finds an XSS vulnerability in a web application, they can construct a JavaScript payload which retrieves the values of a user&#8217;s session cookie or of in-page session variables and sends them to a server run by the attacker, where it can then be used to impersonate the victim.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>In detail:</span>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <span>The attacker finds a cross-site scripting vulnerability in a web server that they want to attack.</span>
      <li>
        <span>The attacker determines how sessions are managed on the site, and creates an XSS payload which exploits this.<span>&nbsp; </span>Typically, this will take the form of a script which retrieves a session cookie or session variable value and submits it to a web server under the control of an attacker, where it is logged.</span>
        <li>
          <span>The attacker prepares the payload for distribution, which includes setting up one or more servers to receive the data, and finding a way to embed the payload in a clickable URL or otherwise deliver it.</span>
          <li>
            <span>The attacker figures out how to use the session data to impersonate a user, which probably involves manually setting a cookie value.</span>
            <li>
              <span>The attacker selects one or more victims.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the attack is targeted, the attacker will have specific users in mind and customize their approach to target those users, but much more frequently, the attacker sends out spam to &#8220;phish&#8221; for users, attempting to get them to follow an ill-crafted link.</span>
              <li>
                <span>If a victim clicks on the link, the website appears to load normally, and they log in as usual.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once they&#8217;re logged in, the exploit sends their session to the attacker&#8217;s server.</span>
                <li>
                  <span>The attacker then uses the logged values in real time to begin impersonating the user.<span>&nbsp; </span>Assuming things work as planned; they can now emulate the user and conduct whatever actions within the hijacked user&#8217;s context.</span>
                </li>
              </li>
            </li>
          </li>
        </li>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <span>
    </span>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>
    <span>Predicting a session</span>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <span>Sometimes, session hijacking can be extremely simple.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the server assigns session IDs in a predictable manner, an attacker can just guess other valid sessions instead of going through the trouble of stealing them.<span>&nbsp; </span>To perform this attack, an attacker logs into a site several times in succession and records the session IDs they&#8217;re given.<span>&nbsp; </span>If there is a predictable relationship between them, they can hijack a session by simply logging in once and then trying sessions which should fall immediately before or after their session ID.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some servers will use a simple incrementing number, allowing an attacker who receives a session ID of 138130 to try 138131 and 138129, for example.<span>&nbsp; </span>In other cases, perhaps a timestamp will be added, which may take more tries, but which can still be brute-forced fairly quickly.<span>&nbsp; </span>Slightly more secure sites will use a randomly generated number, but mistakenly use a weak random number generator.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the attacker can gather enough sequential or nearly sequential IDs, they can often determine the algorithm and seed used, again allowing them to guess sessions at will.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>
  </p>
  <h2>
    <span>
    </span>&nbsp;</h2>
  <h2>
    <span>Session Fixation</span>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <span>With session fixation, instead of learning an existing session ID or guessing one, an attacker provides a session ID to the victim and then takes the session back over once they&#8217;ve supplied their credentials.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>First, the attacker loads the site and receives a new session ID.<span>&nbsp; </span>They embed this ID into a clickable URL in such a way that the site will recognize that ID as the current session for anyone who clicks on the URL.<span>&nbsp; </span>Next, they send this link to the victim (this attack works better for pre-selected victims) in such a way that the victim is convinced to use the link to visit the site.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the victim logs in, the attacker starts using the session again, and impersonates the victim at will.</span>

    <span>Step 2:<span>&nbsp; </span>Identify high risk components</span>
  </h1>
  <p>
    <span>Now that you understand the kinds of vulnerabilities you need to deal with, you can start to examine how they can affect your site.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you have access to the source code, find all of the session management code in the system - hopefully, it will be centralized.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even if you don&#8217;t have access to the code, you need to make a list of all pages in the system which use sessions.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once you understand how sessions are used in the code, you need to learn how to recognize the problems and solutions around two parts of the code that can allow session hijacking vulnerabilities to occur; session generation and session ID protection.</span>
  </p>
  <h2>
    <span>Finding Session Management Code: </span>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <span>If you have access to the source code of the application:</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>
      <span>&nbsp;</span>This will be much easier, because most applications do all of their session management in a single place.<span>&nbsp; </span>If there is a page template in your application, chances are good that it will handle session management.<span>&nbsp; </span>Examine the template and determine if this is true.<span>&nbsp; </span>Figure out how to recognize if a page is using or transmitting the session data both from the source code and purely from the client side, by locating session variables in the outputted page or by viewing cookies sent as part of the HTTP transaction with a proxy like the Burp suite.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ensure that you know where sessions are generated, and make a list of all pages in the application which handle session data, even if they don&#8217;t use it directly.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>If you don&#8217;t have access to the source code of the application:</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Without source code, this is somewhat more difficult.<span>&nbsp; </span>Start by looking at the source code of loaded pages and the HTTP transactions sent to load them (using a proxy like the Burp suite) to determine what your session variables look like.<span>&nbsp; </span>This will let you determine which pages in the site use sessions.<span>&nbsp; </span>Make a list of all the pages in the application which handle session data, even if they don&#8217;t use it directly.</span>
  </p>

    <span>
    </span>&nbsp;</h2>
  <h2>
    <span>Session Generation Problems and Solutions</span>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <span>The first issue to look at is when sessions are generated. <span>&nbsp;</span>If a site has user-customized functionality, it is common that a session will be generated immediately upon loading the site, instead of when the user logs in.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is easy to determine by checking for the presence of a session variable attached to pages served when a user isn&#8217;t logged in.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even if the session isn&#8217;t actually used, one may still be created immediately if session management is handled by the same template on all pages.<span>&nbsp; </span>If a session is created prior to login, it&#8217;s critical that the old session be invalidated and a new session created when the user logs in.<span>&nbsp; </span>This way, session fixation attacks will fail.<span>&nbsp; </span>Checking this is simple - just see if the session values change during login.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Note: If a site isn&#8217;t using cookies to store their sessions and the user has multiple windows open, only the window which the user used to log into the site will get the new session.<span>&nbsp; </span>Make sure this is true if this applies to your application, or the site may be automatically converting the old session ID to a new ID, which means session fixation attacks can still work.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Now that you&#8217;ve checked when sessions are generated, look at how their IDs are generated.<span>&nbsp; </span>Make sure that the IDs are sufficiently large and random.<span>&nbsp; </span>Good session identifiers are at least 64 bits long; 128 is strongly preferred.<span>&nbsp; </span>They should never be sequential, and, whenever possible, should be generated by cryptographically secure random number generators.<span>&nbsp; </span>Determining the degree of randomness can be difficult without access to the application&#8217;s source code; however, there are tools available, such as Burp&#8217;s sequencer, to aid in this task.<span>&nbsp; </span>This tool, included in the Burp Suite, can measure the degree of randomness (entropy) of session tokens generated by a specific site and determine if they are reasonably safe<a style="mso-endnote-id: edn1" title="" href="about:blank#_edn1" name="_ednref1"><span><span><span><span><span>&#91;i&#93;</span></span></span></span></span></a>. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Other tools such as OWASP&#8217;s WebScarab and IBM Rational&#8217;s AppScan have similar functionality. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>The final thing to look at in the session generation process is what happens to old sessions.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sessions should time out after some time period - thirty minutes is appropriate for most applications.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the user logs out, the session should also be invalidated.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s fairly common for insecure sites that use session cookies to simply delete the session cookies when the user logs out, but to leave the session as valid.<span>&nbsp; </span>If an attacker has hijacked the session, this leaves the user with no way of stopping them.</span>
  </p>

  <h2>
    <span>Session ID Protections and Problems</span>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <span>There are two ways that an attacker can learn the value of a session ID - cross-site scripting and sniffing.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are several layers of protection which should be applied to session IDs to prevent these problems, all of which are fairly easy to test for.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>The most basic thing that an application can do to protect session IDs is to use SSL (HTTPS) for all pages which use sessions.<span>&nbsp; </span>Checking if a site is using SSL is easy - just check that the URLs for the site start with </span>
    <span>https://</span>
    <span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>If they do, there are few more things to look at.<span>&nbsp; </span>First, make sure that the site won&#8217;t allow you to change the URL back to http://.<span>&nbsp; </span>Next, make sure that all the elements in the page use SSL (your browser will tell you if it doesn&#8217;t, if it&#8217;s configured to do so.)<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, check that a proper certificate, which is signed by a well-known CA is being used, that the certificate is current, and that sufficiently strong encryption is being used - all of the information that your browser can give you.<span>&nbsp; </span>The last step is slightly more time consuming; you need to ensure that all pages in the site that will see the session ID use SSL.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s ok if some pages don&#8217;t use SSL, as long as you check to make sure that those pages don&#8217;t ever receive, request, or embed the session ID, as it could then be stolen by an attacker with the ability to sniff a user&#8217;s connection.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>If SSL can&#8217;t be used on the site (generally only a problem when supporting mobile web browsers, and going away quickly there too), hard time-outs should be used.<span>&nbsp; </span>Normally, a session times out at some point after the user last interacted with the site.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sites without SSL should invalidate their sessions at a fixed time after initial login (unless the user logs out first, then of course it should be invalidated immediately.)</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Once you&#8217;ve looked at the basics of how the session variables are passed around, look at how it&#8217;s stored on the client.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are two options here - either as a cookie, or as a page variable.<span>&nbsp; </span>Cookies are the preferred method, because they are easier to protect and manage.<span>&nbsp; </span>The session ID should never be stored in the URL of the page, as this opens up the risk of intermediate proxies or users with access to the client&#8217;s session history stealing the user&#8217;s session.<span>&nbsp; </span>To check for this, look at the URLs used by the site - if they contain long alphanumeric strings which seem to act like session identifiers, the pages in question are probably using this technique.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Another method of passing around session variables is as hidden form parameters.<span>&nbsp; </span>The site is designed so that all links are actually HTTP POST requests, and a hidden parameter is appended to all of them.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can test for this in two ways; first, look at the source code to the page and see if a hidden variable of this type seems to be present. <span>&nbsp;</span>Second, use a proxy to look at the requests which are sent to the server and see if they include such a parameter.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is a poor method of storing session IDs, because if the site is vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks, the ID can be easily extracted from a page and sent to a malicious attacker.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>The preferred way to store sessions is via cookies.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can determine if your application stores it sessions in cookies by having your browser prompt you when it sets cookies, by examining the contents of your cookies while using the application, or by using a proxy and watching for when cookies are set.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>If you application is using cookies and SSL, you&#8217;re doing pretty well, but there are a few things which still need to be checked.<span>&nbsp; </span>First, the cookie should be set as SSL-only.<span>&nbsp; </span>This ensures that even if the user does visit the site without SSL for some reason, they will not accidentally compromise their session.<span>&nbsp; </span>Second, the cookie should be set as HTTP-only.<span>&nbsp; </span>While this flag is still fairly new and not supported in all systems (as of the time of its release, Internet Explorer 6 SP1 and higher is the only browser which supports it, however using it won&#8217;t break systems which don&#8217;t support it), where it is supported, it will prevent JavaScript running on the page from accessing the cookie in most cases.<span>&nbsp; </span>This makes it much more difficult to steal a session via XSS.<span>&nbsp; </span>Both of these flags can be checked by examining the response from the server which sets the cookie with a proxy.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Although the previous protections should mostly deal with this issue, even with all of them used properly, sessions can sometimes still be hijacked via cross-site scripting.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is important to conduct a full review of all pages in an application which handle session IDs.<span>&nbsp; </span>Similar methods, such as response splitting, can also be used to perform this attack.</span>

    <span>Conclusions</span>
  </h1>
  <p>
    <span>Session hijacking occurs when an attacker steals the session ID of a legitimate user of a web service or application.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is usually done with cross-site scripting attacks, although other methods exist.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Stealing a session ID gives attackers the ability to impersonate the victim client on the vulnerable site.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, an attacker could browse an online banking site as if they were the victim.<span>&nbsp; </span>This makes session hijacking extremely dangerous.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>To test for session hijacking bugs you need to understand how session management works and how the various session hijacking attack scenarios work. You need to learn what session hijacking vulnerabilities look like in code, along with what the mitigations to stop them look like, and how to find the areas in your application where they may exist.<span>&nbsp; </span>Finally, start testing your application by looking at the most common vulnerabilities and move on from there to more complex issues.</span>
