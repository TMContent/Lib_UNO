</SPAN>Attackers use the additional response to perform different types of attacks such as cross user defacement, web cache poising, and cross site scripting (XSS).<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN>HTTP response splitting vulnerabilities involve three common parties: the attacker, the vulnerable web server, and the target.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The attacker uses the vulnerable server to carry the attack on the target.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The target is usually an Internet browser client (in cases of XSS and cross user defacement) or a cache server (in cases of cache poisoning).</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Follow these steps to test for HTTP response splitting bugs:</SPAN></P><UL><LI><SPAN>Step 1:<SPAN>&nbsp;

More advanced payloads would include sending session credentials to a site controlled by the attacker. </SPAN></P><H2><SPAN><EM>Payload 3: Web cache poisoning</EM></SPAN></H2><P><SPAN>This popular scenario doesn&#8217;t target an Internet browser client; its targets are web cache servers.<SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>The attacker makes the first request through the web cache server and receives the two split packets.<SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>The attacker then sends a second request to any resource.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The cache server will match the second request with the split response (controlled by the attacker).<SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>This will propagate the attack to any users of the web cache server. The attack string manipulates cache-related headers:</SPAN></P><PRE><SPAN><STRONG>http://vulnsite.com/redirect.php?page</STRONG><SPAN><STRONG>=&#37;0d&#37;0aContent-Type: text/html&#37;0d&#37;0a&#37;0d&#37;0aHTTP/1.1 200 OK&#37;0d&#37;0aLast-Modified: Wed, 13 Jan 2010&#37;0d&#37;0aContent-Type: text/html&#37;0d&#37;0a&#37;0d&#37;0a&lt;html&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;hey&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/html&gt; HTTP/1.</STRONG>1</SPAN></SPAN></PRE><P><SPAN>The scenario follows these steps:</SPAN></P><OL><LI><SPAN>Attacker sends a request <I>A</I> to the web cache server that will be split by the vulnerable server (into <I>a1</I> and <I>a2</I>.</SPAN><LI><SPAN>Cache server forwards this request <I>A</I> to the vulnerable server.</SPAN><LI><SPAN>Vulnerable server sends two responses to cache server: first <I>a1 </I>and then <I>a2</I>.</SPAN><LI><SPAN>Cache server adds entry in the cache associating resource <I>A</I> to <I>a1</I>.</SPAN><LI><SPAN>Attacker sends a request <I>B</I> to the web cache server.</SPAN><LI><SPAN>Cache server adds entry in the cache associating resource <I>B</I> to <I>a2</I>.</SPAN></LI></OL><P><SPAN>Since the attacker fully controls <I>a2, </I>he can poison resource <I>B</I> in the cache with anything.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Setting the </SPAN><SPAN>Last-Modified</SPAN><SPAN> </SPAN><SPAN>header to a future date makes the cache server return the attacker&#8217;s page instead of contacting the origin server to request the page from its valid domain.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The attacker can also use the </SPAN><SPAN>Cache-Control </SPAN><SPAN>or the </SPAN><SPAN>Pragma</SPAN><SPAN> header to control how a cache server handles responses and updates its records.</SPAN></P><H2><SPAN><EM>Payload 4: Page Hijacking</EM></SPAN></H2><P><SPAN>This attack is achieved through a proxy server.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The attacker needs to pay extra attention to timing since it needs to make a request at the correct time to get back a response that was previously made by a legitimate user.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The scenario follows these specific steps &#91;ii&#93;:</SPAN></P><OL><LI><SPAN>Attacker sends a request to the proxy server <I>A</I> that will be split by the vulnerable web server (into <I>a1</I> and <I>a2</I>).</SPAN><LI><SPAN>Proxy server forwards this request <I>A</I> to the vulnerable server.</SPAN><LI><SPAN>Vulnerable server sends two responses: first <I>a1 </I>and then <I>a2</I>.</SPAN><LI><SPAN>Proxy server forwards <I>a1 </I>it to the attacker and keeps <I>a2</I>.</SPAN><LI><SPAN>Victim client sends a request <I>B</I> for a confidential page to the web server through the proxy.</SPAN><LI><SPAN>Proxy forwards <I>B</I> to the web server.</SPAN><LI><SPAN>Proxy sends the second response from the server <I>a2 </I>to the victim client (instead of the response <I>b</I>).</SPAN><LI><SPAN>Proxy receives response <I>b </I>from the web server.</SPAN><LI><SPAN>Attacker sends a request <I>C</I> to the web server over the proxy.</SPAN><LI><SPAN>Proxy server sends the response <I>b</I> to the attacker (instead of the response <I>c</I>).</SPAN></LI></OL><P><SPAN>Since the attacker was able to insert an unexpected response to the communication flow, the proxy server gets sends the response <I>b</I> containing confidential data to the wrong client (the attacker).<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></P><P><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></P><H1><SPAN>Step 2:<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Analyze Causes and Countermeasures</SPAN></H1><P><SPAN>The next step is to comprehend what causes HTTP response splitting vulnerabilities and how to defend against them.<SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>This knowledge will aid you in recognizing this attack class in the source codebase and use best coding practices.</SPAN></P><H2><SPAN><EM>HTTP Response Splitting Causes</EM></SPAN></H2><P><SPAN>HTTP protocol specifications indicate that each header is separated by a carriage return character (CR, ASCII 0x0D) followed by a line feed character (LF, ASCII 0x0A) represented as the string </SPAN><SPAN>CR/LF</SPAN><SPAN>.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>In addition, the response headers are separated by the body by two (</SPAN><SPAN>CR/LF/CR/LF). </SPAN></P><P><SPAN>HTTP response splitting attacks work by injecting </SPAN><SPAN>CR/LF</SPAN><SPAN> strings into</SPAN><SPAN> </SPAN><SPAN>HTTP headers.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Web applications that build headers without checking for </SPAN><SPAN>CR/LF </SPAN><SPAN>are vulnerable to this attack.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Failing to check data used for header construction and remove malicious </SPAN><SPAN>CR/LF</SPAN><SPAN> is what allows the attack and the cause of this vulnerability.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>There are different functions to build HTTP headers depending on the language of use.</SPAN></P><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P><B><SPAN>Class.Function/Property</SPAN></B></P></TD><TD><P><B><SPAN>Language</SPAN></B></P></TD></TR><TR><TD><PRE><SPAN>response.setContentType(), &lt;CODE&gt;response.setHeader() &lt;/CODE&gt;</SPAN></PRE><PRE><SPAN>HttpServletResponse.setHeader(),</SPAN></PRE><PRE><SPAN>HttpServletResponse.addHeader(),</SPAN></PRE><PRE><SPAN>HttpServletResponse.setIntHeader(),</SPAN></PRE><PRE><SPAN>HttpServletResponse.addIntHeader(),</SPAN></PRE><PRE><SPAN>HttpServletResponse.setDateHeader(),</SPAN></PRE><PRE><SPAN>HttpServletResponse.addDateHeader(),</SPAN></PRE><PRE><SPAN>pServletResponse.setContentType(),</SPAN></PRE></TD><TD><P><SPAN>Java</SPAN></P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P><SPAN>Response.Headers.Set(), HttpResonse.Redirect(), HttpResponse.setCookie(),</SPAN><SPAN> </SPAN><SPAN>HttpResponse.HeaderName</SPAN><SPAN></SPAN></P></TD><TD><P><SPAN>ASP .NET</SPAN></P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P><SPAN>header()</SPAN></P></TD><TD><P><SPAN>PHP</SPAN></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>It is important to note that, even victims of this attack are web clients, this is a server-side bug.</SPAN></P><H2><SPAN><EM>HTTP Response Splitting Countermeasures</EM></SPAN></H2><P><SPAN>There is a simple solution for response splitting bugs: check the data in the headers before sending them to the client.<SPAN>&nbsp;

</SPAN>An alternative approach is to have a white list that indicates the safe patterns to write to the headers.<SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>The server checks the data to be written to the header to see if it matches one of the white list&#8217;s safe patterns.<SPAN>&nbsp;
