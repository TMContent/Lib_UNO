    <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>If your application uses forms authentication, make sure that your forms authentication is protected by appropriate configuration of the <b>forms</b> and <b>machineKey</b> elements. Ensure that authentication and role cookies are encrypted and checked for integrity. Make sure that the <b>authorization</b> element is configured appropriately to restrict access to your application's sensitive pages. Configure file upload limits in the <b>maxRequestLength</b> attribute on the <b>httpRuntime</b> element, and make sure that you prevent the download of unused file types by removing unnecessary MIME type mappings from IIS and by mapping unused ASP.NET file extensions to the <b>HttpForbiddenHandler</b> class in the <b>httpHandlers</b> section. Use health monitoring to log security-related events, such as failed login attempts.</p>
