  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>Rather than applying security in a haphazard manner, use threat modeling to identify threats systematically.</p>
  <p>To begin identifying threats, identify your security objectives. Clear objectives help you to focus the threat modeling activity and determine how much effort to spend on subsequent steps. Next, create an application overview by itemizing your application's important characteristics and actors. This helps you to identify relevant threats. After creating the overview, decompose your application. A detailed understanding of the mechanics of your application makes it easier for you to uncover more relevant and more detailed security threats. To identify threats that are relevant to your application scenario, use the details discovered so far and use a combination of threat pick lists and a question driven approach that considers the goals of a potential attacker. Finally, identify vulnerabilities by reviewing the layers of your application to find weaknesses related to the threats you already identified. Use vulnerability categories to help you focus on those areas where mistakes are most often made. </p>
