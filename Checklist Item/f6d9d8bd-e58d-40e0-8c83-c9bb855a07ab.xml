  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>The designated key custodians should sign a form to acknowledge they understand their responsibilities.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Review the information security policy to make sure it includes a blank form for encryption key custodians. Review the network documentation to make sure it includes the signed key custodian forms.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Designate several staff members as key custodians. Have them study the relevant parts of the information security policy and key management procedures. Interview the key custodians to verify that they understand their responsibilities. Prepare a form for the key custodians to sign to acknowledge that they accept responsibility for the keys. Have the key custodians sign the forms. Include a blank copy of the form in the information security policy and the signed forms in the network documentation.</p>
