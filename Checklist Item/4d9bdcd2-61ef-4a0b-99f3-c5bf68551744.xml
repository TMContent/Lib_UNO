  <ul>
    <li>ASP.NET 4.0</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure your application allows its users to verify the authenticity of your application.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Some applications are targets for phishing attacks. Failure to provide authentication of the application for the user allows attackers to spoof the application, therefore, fooling the users into submitting their credentials or other sensitive information into an attacker's malicious application.</p>
  <h1>How To Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to ensure the application is capable of proving its authenticity to its users:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Ensure that your application uses SSL to identify itself to the user. Check that your application's environment has enabled HTTPS. Verify that transactions of a sensitive nature are transmitted only over HTTPS connections. Check if the &lt;<em>forms</em>&gt; element in your application's W<em>eb.config</em> file has the <em>requireSSL</em> attribute set to "<em>true</em>" when performing form-based authentication:</p>
      <pre>&lt;authentication mode="Forms"&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;forms loginUrl="login.aspx"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; protection="All"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; timeout="20"<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; requireSSL="true"&gt;&amp;nbsp; <br />&lt;/forms&gt;<br />&lt;/authentication&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Check if your application displays a shared secret with its users. Check if your application has a personal shared secret for each of its users. Shared secrets include, but are not limited to, combinations of any of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Layout</strong>: a user-defined layout/color scheme </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Picture</strong>: a user-defined image </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Word/Phrase</strong>: a user-defined word, phrase, or question </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Verify that the shared secret is displayed to the user after providing their ID and before providing their credentials.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How To Fix</h1>
  <p>Use the following measures to authenticate your application to its users:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use SSL.</strong> Due to the nature of the SSL certificates, SSL can be used to certify the remote host's name. Because of SSL's chain of trust and DNS limitations, spoofing a host that uses SSL is very difficult.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Display personalized and identifiable content.</strong> Do not ask the user for credentials at once. Following the user to entering a username, display a personal and identifiable content to which the user can relate. Examples of such are a personal user-supplied question, an image that has been pre-selected from a library, or a personalized color schema. After the user has authenticated the application, they may enter their password. This should only be used as an additional measure to verify the authenticity of your application and should not be used to replace SSL.</p>
