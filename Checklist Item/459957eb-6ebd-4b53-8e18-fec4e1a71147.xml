    <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure access rights to log files are appropriately set. Application accounts should have write-only access and operators and support personnel should have read-only access as needed.&amp;nbsp; Administrators accounts are the only accounts which should have full access.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Restricting access to log files makes it harder for attackers to tamper with log files to cover their tracks.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, it reduces opportunities for the repudiation or forging of actions.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Check Windows ACLs on log files to ensure they are properly restricted:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Application accounts should have write-only access <li>Operators and support personnel should have read-only access as needed <li>Administrators are the only accounts that should have full access</li></li></li>
  </ul>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Logging normally comes in two flavors, either logging to a file or logging to SQL server.&amp;nbsp; Here's a look at how you can secure access to each of these:</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Logging to Files</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Protect audit and log files using Windows ACLs and restrict access to the log files. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Assign appropriate permissions to the log files. <ul><li>Logs should be written by a process with write permission only. <li>Logs should be read only by users with administrative access.</li></li></ul><li>Minimize the number of individuals who can manipulate the log files.&amp;nbsp; Authorize access only to highly trusted accounts such as administrators. </li></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Logging to SQL Server</strong>
  </p>
  <p>If you log events to SQL Server or to some custom event sink, use appropriate access controls to limit access to the event data.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Grant write access to the account or accounts used by your application <li>Grant full control to administrators <li>Grant read-only access to operators. <li>Minimize the number of individuals who can manipulate the log files.&amp;nbsp; Authorize access only to highly trusted accounts such as administrators.</li></li></li></li>
  </ul>
