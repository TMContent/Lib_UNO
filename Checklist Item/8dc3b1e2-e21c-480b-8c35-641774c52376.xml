  <p>Verify that threats to data are considered.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Consider the threats to stored data to help make decisions about how to encrypt stored data.</p>
  <h1>How To Check</h1>
  <p>To verify that threats to data are considered:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify sensitive data.</strong> Make a list of assets that should be protected with encryption.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Identify encryption solutions.</strong> For each asset that should be protected with encryption, identify a software solution that is being used to secure it.</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Identify threats to sensitive data.</strong> Make a list of types of threats to stored sensitive data. For example: insider attacks, external attacks, organized crime, industrial espionage, etc.</p>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Verify that solutions are appropriate.</strong> Make sure that the deployed encryption systems offer adequate protection from the likely threats to the stored sensitive data.</p>
          </li>
