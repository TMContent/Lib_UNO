  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 11.2 </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Internal and external vulnerability scans should be performed at least quarterly. Internal vulnerability scans should be performed after any significant changes to the network.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Automated vulnerability scans may detect security holes and misconfigurations with relatively little effort.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to make sure vulnerability scans are performed regularly and in compliance with PCI DSS:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Review policy.</strong> Examine the information security policy to verify that it includes the following requirements: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A requirement for internal vulnerability scans to be performed at least quarterly and after any significant changes to the network <li>A requirement for external vulnerability scans to be performed at least quarterly <li>A requirement for quarterly external vulnerability scan results to satisfy PCI Security Scanning Proceduresquarterly external vulnerability scans to be performed by an Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) <li>A requirement for all found vulnerabilities to be fixed <li>A requirement for scans to be repeated until no more vulnerabilities are found</li></li></li></li></li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Review documentation.</strong> Examine the results of previous vulnerability scans to verify that they have been performed regularly and that rescans have been performed until passing results were obtained.</p>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Perform the following tasks to assure that vulnerability scans are performed regularly and in compliance with PCI DSS:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Update policy.</strong> Add the following requirements to the information security policy: <ul><li>A requirement to perform an internal vulnerability scan at least quarterly and after any significant changes to the network <li>A requirement to perform an external vulnerability scan at least quarterly <li>A requirement to have the quarterly external vulnerability scan results satisfy PCI Security Scanning Procedures <li>A requirement to have the quarterly external vulnerability scans performed by an Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) <li>A requirement to to fix all discovered vulnerabilities <li>A requirement to to repeat the scan until no more vulnerabilities are found</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><li><strong>Perform scans.</strong> Perform&amp;nbsp;vulnerability scans regularly, document them, and attach the results to the security documentation.</li></li>
  </ol>
