    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 8.5.11</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Passwords should have both letters and numbers in them.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using both letters and numbers in passwords makes it harder for an attacker to crack the passwords.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to check if controls are in place to force users to have passwords that include both letters and numbers in an Active Directory environment:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Launch the "Group Policy Management" console. </strong>The "Group Policy Management" console is included in Windows 2008, but has to be downloaded and installed on Windows 2003 and 2000. The link to the download is available at the bottom of this page. To launch the "Group Policy Management" console, execute the "gpmc.msc" command.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Launch the Group Policy Object Editor.</strong>&amp;nbsp;Navigate to the "Group Policy Objects" folder under the current domain, right click on the GPO and select "Edit".</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Verify that the "Password must meet complexity requirements" policy is used. </strong>For each relevant domain, check that there is a linked group policy object that enables the "Password must meet complexity requirements" policy. The "Password must meet complexity requirements" policy is enabled on Windows 2003 and 2008 by default and is configured to require both letters and numbers in passwords. The default GPO that includes this setting is called "Default Domain Policy." The "Password must meet complexity requirements" policy is located under "Windows Settings, "Security Settings", "Account Policies&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Password Policy", &amp;#8220;Password must meet complexity requirements". Verify that this policy is enabled.</p>
        </li>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to assure that passwords are required to have both letters and numbers in an Active Directory environment:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Launch the "Group Policy Management" console. </strong>The "Group Policy Management" console is included in Windows 2008, but has to be downloaded and installed on Windows 2003 and 2000. The link to the download is available at the bottom of this page. To launch the "Group Policy Management" console, execute the "gpmc.msc" command.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Edit or create a Group Policy Object (GPO).</strong> To create and activate a new Group Policy Object (GPO), launch "The Group Policy Management" console, right click on the domain and select "Create and Link a GPO Here." To edit an existing GPO, navigate to the "Group Policy Objects" folder under the current domain, right click on the GPO and select "Edit" - this will open the "Group Policy Object Editor." To change the settings of a GPO using the "Group Policy Object Editor, navigate the folders to find the setting of interest, double click on it, set the desired option(s).</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Enable&amp;nbsp;the "Password must meet complexity requirements" policy.</strong>&amp;nbsp;The "Password must meet complexity requirements" policy is located under "Windows Settings, "Security Settings", "Account Policies&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Password Policy", &amp;#8220;Password must meet complexity requirements". Set the "Password must meet complexity requirements" policy to "Enabled".</p>
        </li>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
