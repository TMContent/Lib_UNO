    <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that sensitive information, such as connection strings, user credentials, and encryption keys are not hard coded in your application.</p>
  <p />
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Do not hard code sensitive information, such as connection strings, user credentials, and encryption keys. An attacker who has access to your assembly can access the sensitive information by examining the MSIL, by using a disassembler, or by using reflection.</p>
  <p>If you must store secrets in code, use a strong obfuscator to make sure that the class or member of the class that stores the hard coded secret is obfuscated.</p>
