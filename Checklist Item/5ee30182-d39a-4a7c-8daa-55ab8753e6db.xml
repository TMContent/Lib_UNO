  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>The network should have a segment designated as the DMZ. The DMZ is the network segment that has Internet access and may handle incoming Internet traffic. There may be more than one DMZ.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The DMZ is a defense-in-depth measure used to separate systems that are open to attacks from those that hold sensitive information. When a DMZ is implemented, even if the systems in the DMZ are compromised, the attacker does not have full access to the sensitive information.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Check the network diagram to ensure that a network segment is designated as the DMZ. Check that the physical network matches the network diagram. Check that Internet access is limited to the network devices in the DMZ.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Designate a network segment as the DMZ. Install and configure a firewall between the DMZ and the Internet. Install and configure a firewall between the DMZ and the internal network segment. Document the network. For more information about setting up a DMZ, please refer to the article, &amp;#8220;Configure the Routers for PCI DSS Compliance,&amp;#8221; linked below.</p>
