  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that router vendor's security notification service is subscribed to reduce the attack surface area.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>On a deployed router, every open port is associated with a listening service. To reduce the attack surface area, default services that are not required should be shut down. Examples include <b>bootps </b>and <b>Finger</b>, which are rarely required. You should also scan your router to detect which ports are open.</p>
