  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Processes should be in place to keep the staff informed of the latest discovered security vulnerabilities. Such processes may involve signing up for a mailing list and visiting web-sites focused on security.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The information security community is very active on-line and provides many valuable resources for tracking the latest discovered vulnerabilities. Potential attackers monitor these resources, so it is important to mitigate these new threats before they are exploited.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Interview the responsible personnel and ask them what resources they use to keep track of the newly discovered security vulnerabilities. </p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Add a requirement to the information security policy for the responsible staff members to use outside resources to stay informed about the latest discovered security vulnerabilities. Instruct the staff to review on-line security vulnerability tracking resources periodically. Instruct at least one staff member to sign up for the BugTraq mailing list and other similar mailing lists as appropriate.</p>
