      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Make&amp;nbsp;a list of user accounts.</strong> Use the user management application to review user accounts. Make a list of accounts. In a Microsoft Active Directory environment, the user management application can be launched by clicking on "Start", "Programs", "Administrative Tools", "Active Directory Users and Computers".</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Compare the list of authorized users to the list of user accounts.</strong> Identify the user corresponding to each account to make sure the user exists and uses the account. Make sure that all the authorized users have accounts.</p>
        </li>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Create a new user account.</strong> To create a new user, navigate to the user list, right click on it, select "New", "User"</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Configure the new user account.</strong> Fill in the user account information in the "New Object - User" dialog.
