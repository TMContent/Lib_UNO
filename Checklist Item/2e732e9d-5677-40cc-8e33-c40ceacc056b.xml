    <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that destructors don't throw exceptions if they are called when an exception is thrown. The best way to do this is by not throwing exceptions from destructors.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>A destructor may be called when an exception is thrown. If a destructor throws an exception after being called from an exception being thrown, the program is likely to terminate. This may result in a denial-of-service vulnerability.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Search for destructors. Verify that destructors don't throw exceptions when they are called as a result of other exceptions being thrown. The simplest way to do this is by not throwing exceptions from destructors.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Identify destructors that throw exceptions. Rewrite code so that destructors don't throw exceptions.</p>
