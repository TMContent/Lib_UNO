  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Network devices should have unused functionality removed if possible.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The less functionality a network device implements, the less surface area available for a potential attacker to exploit.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Make a list of all network devices. Identify the function(s) of each network device. Note that each server should have only one primary function. Identify the features required to implement the stated function(s) of each network device. Make sure that all unnecessary functions and applications are removed from the network device if possible. Verify that all enabled functions are documented.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Install and configure the necessary features and applications on each network device to fulfill its intended purpose. Document the stated purpose of each network device and the features and applications used to implement it. Remove all other features and applications if possible.The features to remove include: scripts, drivers, file systems, applications, etc. Some features may be built-in to the Operating System or firmware and therefore difficult or impractical to remove. In that case, disable the unneeded features if possible.</p>
