  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>When a user is locked out after repeatedly entering invalid authentication credentials, the lockout should last at least 30 minutes.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Locking the terminal after repeated failed authentication attempts ensures that an attacker cannot guess the password in a timely manner.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to check if controls are in place to lockout users for at least 30 minutes in the event of repeated authentication failure.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Launch the "Group Policy Management" console. </strong>The "Group Policy Management" console is included in Windows 2008, but has to be downloaded and installed on Windows 2003 and 2000. The link to the download is available at the bottom of this page. To launch the "Group Policy Management" console, execute the "gpmc.msc" command.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Launch the Group Policy Object Editor.</strong>&amp;nbsp;Navigate to the "Group Policy Objects" folder under the current domain, right click on the GPO and select "Edit".</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Verify that the "Account lockout duration" policy is used.</strong> For each relevant domain, check that there is a linked group policy object that enables the "Account lockout duration" policy. The "Account lockout duration" policy is not enabled by default on Windows 2003 and 2008, so verify that it has been enabled. The "Account lockout duration" policy is located under "Windows Settings", "Security Settings", "Account Policies", "Account Lockout", &amp;#8220;Account lockout duration".</p>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to assure that user accounts are locked out for at least 30 minutes in the event of repeated authentication failure in an Active Directory environment:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Launch the "Group Policy Management" console. </strong>The "Group Policy Management" console is included in Windows 2008, but has to be downloaded and installed on Windows 2003 and 2000. The link to the download is available at the bottom of this page. To launch the "Group Policy Management" console, execute the "gpmc.msc" command.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Edit or create a Group Policy Object (GPO).</strong> To create and activate a new Group Policy Object (GPO), launch "The Group Policy Management" console, right click on the domain and select "Create and Link a GPO Here." To edit an existing GPO, navigate to the "Group Policy Objects" folder under the current domain, right click on the GPO and select "Edit" - this will open the "Group Policy Object Editor." To change the settings of a GPO using the "Group Policy Object Editor, navigate the folders to find the setting of interest, double click on it, set the desired option(s).</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Enable&amp;nbsp;the "Account lockout duration" policy.</strong>&amp;nbsp;The "Account lockout duration" policy is located under "Windows Settings", "Security Settings", "Account Policies", "Account Lockout", &amp;#8220;Account lockout duration". Set the "Account lockout duration" policy to 30 minutes or more.</p>
        </li>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
