          <strong>Check that the information security policy&amp;nbsp;addresses all PCI DSS requirements.</strong> Get a copy of the PCI DSS document. Go through the information security policy and cross out the PCI DSS requirements that are covered by each respective policy requirement.

          <strong>Delegate responsibility for maintaining the information security policy. </strong>Delegate responsibility for maintaining the information security policy up-to-date to qualified&amp;nbsp;staff and instruct them to review the information security policy annually and to update it as needed. </p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Conduct an annual risk assessment.</strong> Define an annual risk assessment process. This process should consist of a vulnerability scan and a penetration scan. Add the definition and a requirement to carry out the assessment annually to the information security policy. </p>
