  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Check to ensure that failed logon attempts are audited to detect and trace suspicious behavior.</p>
  <p />
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>You must log failed logon attempts to be able to detect and trace suspicious behavior.</p>
  <p>
    <b>To audit failed logon attempts</b>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Start the Local Security Policy tool from the Administrative Tools program group. 
<li>Expand <b>Local Policies</b> and then select <b>Audit Policy</b><li>Double-click <b>Audit account logon events</b>. 
<li>Click <b>Failure</b> and then <b>OK</b>. </li></li></li></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Logon failures are recorded as events in the Windows security event log. The following event IDs are suspicious: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>531</b>. This means an attempt was made to log on using a disabled account. 
<li><b>529</b>. This means an attempt was made to log on using an unknown user account or using a valid user account but with an invalid password. An unexpected increase in the number of these audit events might indicate an attempt to guess passwords. </li></li>
  </ul>
