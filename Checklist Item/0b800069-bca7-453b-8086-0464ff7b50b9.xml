  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that the information security policy requires the firewall configuration to be reviewed at least every six months. Ensure that the results of each scheduled review are included in the network documentation.</p>

  <p>Over time, the network configuration and business requirements might change. A regular review is required to make sure that the firewall configuration accurately matches the business needs while providing an adequate level of security.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Check the information security policy to make sure it includes a requirement for a review of the firewall configuration at least every six months. Check the network documentation to make sure it includes the results of the previous reviews.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Add a point to the information security policy to perform a review of the firewall configuration every six months. Designate staff responsible for performing the review of the firewall configuration. Add the results of each review to the network documentation.</p>
