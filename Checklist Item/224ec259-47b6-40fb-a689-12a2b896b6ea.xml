  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>The network documentation and the Information Security policy should include a requirement for a formal process for testing changes to the router configuration, as well as directions for the procedure to test those changes.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Changes to the router configuration must be tested to make sure that vulnerabilities are not introduced inadvertently&amp;nbsp;by the changes.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Examine the network documentation and the Information Security policy to make sure they include a requirement and a description of a process to test changes to the router configuration.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Add a point to the Information Security policy to require following a specific process to test the router configuration whenever changes are made.&amp;nbsp;Describe a process for testing changes to the router configuration in the network documentation.&amp;nbsp;Perform a test run of the testing process to make sure that it is adequate for your network.</p>
