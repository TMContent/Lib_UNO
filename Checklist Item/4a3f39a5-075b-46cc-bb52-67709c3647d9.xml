  <p>Verify that error messages don't reveal sensitive information.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Revealing sensitive information in error messages may help an attacker gain unauthorized access.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to make sure that error messages don't reveal sensitive information:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify error messages.</strong> Review error handling code and find all instances of error messages being presented to the user.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Inspect error messages.</strong> Verify that error messages are simple, tell user what happened, and don't include any of the following information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>File locations.</strong> Filesystem information, such as the locations of Operating System files, databases, or other sensitive information may be used by an attacker to coordinate his attacks, so this information should not be included in error messages.</p>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>System information.</strong> System information, such as Operating System version, network names, internal network addresses, etc should not be included in error messages because it may help an attacker identify vulnerable software, choose exploits, or attack other systems on the network.</p>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>User account information.</strong> Information such as usernames, personal names, e-mail addresses, or other user information should not be revealed in error messages, because it may help an attacker attack that user account.</p>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Secrets.</strong> It goes without saying that secret information, such as passwords, password hashes, cardholder data, etc should not be disclosed in error messages.</p>
                </li>
              </li>
            </li>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to prevent disclosing sensitive information in error messages:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify error messages.</strong> Review error handling code and find all instances of error messages being presented to the user.</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Use simple error messages.</strong> Write simple messages and warnings that explain to the user what happened but don't include any of the following sensitive information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>File locations.</strong> Filesystem information, such as the locations of Operating System files, databases, or other sensitive information may be used by an attacker to coordinate his attacks, so this information should not be included in error messages.</p>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>System information.</strong> System information, such as Operating System version, network names, internal network addresses, etc should not be included in error messages because it may help an attacker identify vulnerable software, choose exploits, or attack other systems on the network.</p>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>User account information. </strong>Information such as usernames, personal names, e-mail addresses, or other user information should not be revealed in error messages, because it may help an attacker attack that user account.</p>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Secrets.</strong> It goes without saying that secret information, such as passwords, password hashes, cardholder data, etc should not be disclosed in error messages.</p>
                </li>
              </li>
            </li>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Use simple error messages.</strong> Rewrite code that displays error messages to the user to display new, simple error messages.</p>
        </li>
      </li>
    </li>
