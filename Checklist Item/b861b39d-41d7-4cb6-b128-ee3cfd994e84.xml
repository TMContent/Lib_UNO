  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>The data that has been erased should not be recoverable.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Identify the method used to erase sensitive data. Data is considered to be erased securely if all the drive space that it has occupied is overwritten at least once. Make sure that the erasing mechanism overwrites all the disk data occupied by sensitive data at least once. Run a forensic application on a sample of files that have been erased using the chosen secure deletion method to make sure the files cannot be recovered.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Identify the sensitive data to erase. Choose an application capable of erasing files securely. Install and configure an application to erase the sensitive data securely. Run a forensic application on a sample of files that have been erased using the chosen secure deletion method to make sure the files cannot be recovered.</p>
