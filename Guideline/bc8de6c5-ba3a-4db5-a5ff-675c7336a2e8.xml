* JSP


## What to Do ##

Escape HTML special characters in all user input that is displayed in HTML contexts. Data is said to be in a HTML context when that data is rendered as a part of a HTML document and is understood by the browser to be HTML. There are other contexts available to Web Applications, such as JavaScript context, CSS context, etc. Data is said to be in a JavaScript context when it is included in JavaScript code and is interpreted as JavaScript by the browser, and so on. Data has to be encoded differently for different contexts to prevent Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. The differences of encoding arise from the fact that different contexts have different special symbols and keywords. Output encoding routines have to be designed with the understanding of the context of the output in mind.


## Problem Example ##

~~~~
<p>User input is: ${user.input}</p>
~~~~

The problem example above is vulnerable to XSS attacks - if the user.input expression contains malicious script entered by an attacker, whoever views the page with the code above will be at risk of running that script in the context of their browser.


## Solution Example ##

~~~~
<p>User input is: <c:out value="${user.input}">Null</c:out></p>
~~~~

In the solution example above, HTML tags are escaped in the expression user.input when being displayed. If the value of user.input is null, the text "Null" is displayed. If the expression user.input contains malicious script entered by an attacker, it will not be executable, because HTML tags will have been escaped, and thus not interpreted as script by the browser.]]></Data>
