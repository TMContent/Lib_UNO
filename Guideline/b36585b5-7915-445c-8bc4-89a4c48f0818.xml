  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Ensure that any sensitive information a user submits to your site does not get logged, either intentionally or as a side-effect of the system design. For instance, if you are resetting a user's password, do not transmit the new password as the argument to an HTTP GET request, as it will be logged in the web server's logs (and potentially also the logs of any intermediate web proxy). Alternately, when designing logging in an order management system, make sure that details like shipping addresses, customer names, and (most importantly) payment details like credit card numbers don't end up in the transaction log.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The permissions required to access log files are often less restrictive than what is required to view sensitive information in an application. By logging sensitive information you may be allowing a less privileged user to view information they would otherwise not have access to. This also increases your attack surface by making your log files a target of interest for attackers.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Apply this guideline if your application handles sensitive data and produces logs. Logs may be file, database, event log, or network based.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Ensuring that sensitive information isn't logged is very easy with a little bit of care. The following steps will walk you through the process:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify sensitive data in your application.</strong> In the design phase, create a list of all sensitive user data your system handles. Include composite data elements which are sensitive in combination, like multi-part registration credentials or fields which together uniquely identify an individual. Remember that sensitive data can come in a wide variety of formats. Names of customers, government issued ID numbers, credit card or other financial information, passwords, and private keys are all examples of sensitive information. Some industries, such as health care and banking, have regulatory standards that define sensitive information. Use regulatory requirements, as they apply to your application, to identify sensitive data. In general sensitive data can be defined as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information that either contains personally identifiable information or can be used to derive personally identifiable information that should not be shared with users. <li>Information that a user provides that they would not want shared with other users of the application. <li>Information that comes from an external trusted source that is not designed to be shared with users. </li></li></li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Ensure sensitive data does not get logged.</strong> When designing a logging architecture for your application, pay special attention to components that will handle sensitive data. Design logging systems for these components so that they do not collect sensitive data. When recording transactions inside your system, log only the minimum amount of information needed. If you're logging a new order from a customer, log only the time, customer ID, and order ID. Information like customer names, items ordered, or payment information can be reconstructed from transaction records and can be left out of the logging system.</p>
        <p>Take special care with error logs, which are a frequent cause of problems. If you create a log event when an exception occurs or when a SQL transaction is rolled back, be sure to sanitize any sensitive information that might exist in the exception context or SQL error before logging it. It's ok to have a verbose logging mode for use when debugging a system, but ensure that verbose logging is not turned on in production. If a problem occurs in production which requires the use of verbose logging, treat any logs generated as sensitive information. If it's likely that this is going to happen, design the logging system to segregate and protect sensitive data.</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Be aware of logs created by external systems.</strong> If your application relies on other systems, understand what data they log and design your system so that sensitive values are not accidentally captured. Keep in mind that these interactions may be transparent within the application's code, such as HTTP server logs which record all values in a GET request.</p>
