  <ul>
    <li>Web Application</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use only tested cryptographic services provided by your platform or web application framework.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Developing cryptogaphic algorithms and the implementations of those algorithms is extremely difficult.&amp;nbsp; Errors which are very hard to spot without a background in cryptanalysis can easily compromise security, while still appearing to be secure.&amp;nbsp; Because reference and system implementations are used by many applications, they're tested heavily by people with the appropriate background, ensuring a high level of dependability.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>All systems which use encryption should use standard implementations and algorithms.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>All platforms provide standard cryptographic libraries, often available as services inside the platform or host operating system.&amp;nbsp; Use those services according to their documentation, taking into account what properties a given algorithm or API can and cannot supply.</p>
