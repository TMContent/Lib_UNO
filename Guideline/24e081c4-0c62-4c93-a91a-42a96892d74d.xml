    <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use role caching if role store lookups are too costly. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>If the performance overhead of role lookup is too great, perhaps because of slow data access or a large number of roles, role caching offers a way to improve performance.&nbsp; If role cookies are properly protected, this change does not directly weaken system security, although it does increase the application's attack surface. </p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>Applications which are running into performance problems related to role store lookups should consider role caching.&nbsp; As it increases the attack surface of the application and requires some care to ensure that vulnerabilities are not introduced, it should only be used when needed. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Enable role caching in the roles cookie by setting the <b>cacheRolesInCookie</b> attribute to <b>true</b> in the Web.config file as shown here. </p>
  <pre>&lt;roleManager enabled="true"             <br />&#9;cacheRolesInCookie="true"      ... &gt;<br />&lt;/roleManager&gt;</pre>
  <p>When role checks are performed, the roles cookie is checked before calling the role provider to check the list of roles within the data source. This improves performance.&nbsp; The cookie is dynamically updated to cache the most recently validated role names.&nbsp; If the role information for a user is too long to store in a cookie, ASP.NET stores only the most recently used role information in the cookie and then it looks up additional role information in the data source as required.&nbsp; The most recently referred to roles end up being cached in the cookie. </p>
