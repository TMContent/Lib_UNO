* ASP.NET


## Summary ##

Do not allow exception details to propagate from your Web applications back to the client. A malicious user could use system-level diagnostic information to learn about your application and probe for weaknesses to exploit in future attacks.


## Solution Example ##

Send detailed error messages to the error log. Send minimal information to the consumer of your service or application, such as a generic error message and custom error log ID that can subsequently be mapped to detailed message in the event logs. Make sure that you do not log passwords or other sensitive data.

**Return Generic Error Pages to the Client**

The <customErrors> element can be used to configure custom, generic error messages that should be returned to the client in the event of an application exception condition. The error page should include a suitably generic error message, optionally with additional support details. You can also use this element to return different error pages depending on the exception condition.

Make sure that the mode attribute is set to "On" and that you have specified a default redirect page as shown below:

~~~~
<customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="YourErrorPage.htm" />
~~~~

The defaultRedirect attribute allows you to use a custom error page for your application, which for example might include support contact details.

Do not use mode="Off" because it causes detailed error pages that contain system-level information to be returned to the client.

If you want separate error pages for different types of error, use one or more <error> elements as shown below. In this example, "404 (not found)" errors are redirected to one page, "500 (internal system errors)" are directed to another page, and all other errors are directed to the page specified on the defaultRedirect attribute.

~~~~
<customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="YourErrorPage.htm">
   <error statusCode="404" redirect="YourNotFoundPage.htm"/>
   <error statusCode="500" redirect="YourInternalErrorPage.htm"/>
</customErrors>
~~~~

**Use a Global Error Handler to Catch Unhandled Exceptions**

Make sure that the code includes an application-level global error handler in Global.asax to catch any exceptions that are not handled in code. This can prevent accidentally returning detailed error information to the client. The code should log all exceptions in the event log to record them for tracking and later analysis.

The application should contain code similar to the following:

~~~~
<%@ Application Language="C#" %>
<%@ Import Namespace="System.Diagnostics" %>

<script language="C#" runat="server">
void Application_Error(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
  // Get reference to the source of the exception chain
  Exception ex = Server.GetLastError().GetBaseException();

  // log the details of the exception and page state to the
  // event log.
  EventLog.WriteEntry( "My Web Application",
                       "MESSAGE: " + ex.Message + 
                       "\nSOURCE: " + ex.Source, 
                       EventLogEntryType.Error);
  // Optional e-mail or other notification here...
}
</script>
