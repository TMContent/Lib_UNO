  <ul>
    <li>ASP.NET 2.0&amp;nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Use an encrypted communication channel to protect data sent between servers. SSL and IPSec can both be used under different circumstances to protect the communication traffic between servers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Servers may not necessarily co-exist in a secure environment. If the communication between&amp;nbsp;two or more servers&amp;nbsp;is not protected, the data sent between them could be compromised via eavesdropping or data manipulation.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your servers are not inside a physically secure data center where the network eavesdropping threat is considered insignificant. </p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Determine the level of desired granularity for the given server/application suite. </li>
    <li>if the protection needs to be applied across all applications, use IPSec. </li>
    <li>if the protection is granular and only a certain portion of the information exchanged between servers is sensitive use SSL</li>
  </ol>
  <p>SSL and IPSec can both be used to help protect communication between servers by encrypting traffic. There are benefits to using a mixed approach consisting of both SSL and IPSec. See the related guidelines for specific details. </p>
