  <ul>
    <li>Applications written using Servlets or JSP.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Avoid making security decisions based on parameters that are sent by the client. </p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Using client-accessible data to make security decisions allows the users to access and modify it. Therefore, an attacker would be able to bypass security measures.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application accepts and processes client-side information, avoid using that information to make security decisions.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Security decisions should not be based on any data that the client has control over. Common mistakes include relying on data inside unprotected cookies, hidden fields or query strings. </p>
  <p>Use the following steps to ensure that no security decisions are based on client-accessible data:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify security decision points. </strong>Carefully examine the points in the code that are related to your application's security model. It is critical that no decision points are placed in the client. Because this is a design issue, it is recommended to use threat modeling to determine and evaluate the security decision points.</p>
      <p />
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Trace data that influences security decisions. </strong>Tracing the data that influences security decisions helps&amp;nbsp;determine if the data is vulnerable to any client-based attacks. Make sure that the client cannot modify or influence this data. </p>
        <p />
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Prove that security-related data cannot be tampered with by the client. </strong>Use cryptography or your application's design to ensure that security related data cannot be tampered with by the client. </p>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Mark all exceptions to this guideline. </strong>Note all exceptions made to this guideline. Thoroughly examine the code associated with such instances. Verify that all instances are provided in the business logic and are intended.</p>
          </li>
        </li>

  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following code illustrates a servlet that accepts user-supplied input. Unfortunately, the application obtains the user's ID from the client which allows&amp;nbsp;an attacker to tamper withj&amp;nbsp;data that influences security decisions.</p>
  <pre>public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,<br />      HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException&amp;#123;<br />      String userID = request.getParameter("userid");<br />       ...<br /> &amp;#125;</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following code illustrates a servlet that accepts user-supplied input. Because the application obtains the user's ID from the user's session, it is not possible for an attacker to tamper with such data.</p>
  <pre>public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,<br />      HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException&amp;#123;<br />      Session sess = request.getSession();<br />      String userID = (String)sess.getAttribute("userid");<br /><br />      ...<br /><br />&amp;#125;</pre>]]></Data>
