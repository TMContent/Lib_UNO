    <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Applies To</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>ASP.NET 4.0</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Remove all test accounts from deployed applications.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Test accounts provide access to the application's functionality during development. Since they are often poorly secured, they are a common target for attackers.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If you use test accounts during application testing, be sure they are removed before deployment.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps when removing test accounts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enumerate all accounts</strong>: List all the users to your application. This should be a full comprehensive list that includes, but is not limited to, active users, inactive users, users pending confirmation, and test accounts.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify their use</strong>: Examine the use/status of each account. Sort the accounts into groups according to their use/status.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Remove the accounts that will no longer be used</strong>: Once the accounts are sorted into groups, list all accounts that are used for test purposes. After identifying all test accounts, remove them from your application's database.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enforce strong passwords on the remaining accounts</strong>: After removing all test accounts, enforce strong passwords for the remaining accounts in your application. Strong passwords decrease the probability of compromising valid users. </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Problem Example</h1>
  <p>The following segment illustrates the user database of a multi-user application. By looking at the other data in the users table, such as user description, status, etc, we can deduce which of the accounts are necessary and which of them exist only for testing purposes. The problem with the user database in this example is the existence of test accounts after the deployment of the application, which can be determined by looking at the status column data.</p>
  <pre>sql&gt; select username, status from users;<br />+----------+-----------+<br />| username | status    |<br />+----------+-----------+<br />| joe      | active    |<br />| adam     | active    |<br />| john     | inactive  |<br />| bob      | active    |<br />| jim      | active    |<br />| sean     | inactive  |<br />| ellen    | active    |<br />| mary     | active    |<br />| susan    | active    |<br />| julie    | active    |<br />| test01   | test      |<br />| test02   | test      |<br />| test03   | test      |<br />+----------+-----------+</pre>
  <h1>Solution Example</h1>
  <p>The following segment illustrates the user database of a multi-user application. The user database is populated with active users and no test accounts.</p>
  <pre>sql&gt; select username, status from users;<br />+----------+-----------+<br />| username | status    |<br />+----------+-----------+<br />| joe      | active    |<br />| adam     | active    |<br />| bob      | active    |<br />| jim      | active    |<br />| ellen    | active    |<br />| mary     | active    |<br />| susan    | active    |<br />| julie    | active    |<br />+----------+-----------+</pre>
