  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Examine what algorithms your application uses and for what purpose and ensure that correct algorithm and correct key sizes are being used.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Cryptography only provides real security if it is used appropriately and the right algorithms are used for the right job. The strength of the algorithm is also important.&amp;nbsp; Larger key sizes result in improved security, but performance suffers. Stronger encryption is most important for persisted data that is retained in data stores for prolonged periods of time.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>If your application uses cryptography to provide security, examine what algorithm and key size it uses and the way it is used.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p />It is important to make sure you choose the right algorithm for the right job and to make sure you use a key size that provides a sufficient degree of security. Larger key sizes generally increase security. The following list summarizes the major algorithms together with the key sizes that each uses: <ul><li>Rijndael 128-256 bit keys (16-32 bytes) </li><li>RSA 384-16,384 bit keys (48-2,048 bytes) </li></ul><p>For large data encryption, use Rijndael,&amp;nbsp;also known as Advanced Encryption Standard(AES). As per NIST&amp;nbsp;recomendations, 192-256-bit AES&amp;nbsp;keys are required for highly sensitive data. For digital signatures, use Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA). NIST guidelines suggest that 15360-bit RSA keys are equivalent&amp;nbsp;to 256-bit symmetric keys in strength. <br /></p><br /><h1>&amp;nbsp;</h1><hr /><p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance.</p>]]></Data>
