  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 2.2.1.a</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Implement only one primary function per server and disable all other network services.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The fewer network services that run on a server, the fewer potential vulnerabilities there are for an attacker to exploit.</p>
  <h1>When</h1>
  <p>The primary function should be implemented and all other network services should be disabled when a server is being configured.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following tasks to implement only one function per server:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Implement the main function of the server.</strong> Identify the primary function of the server. Install and configure features and applications necessary to implement the primary function of the server. </p>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Remove all other services and functionality.</strong> Identify all the network services running on the server. If possible, remove or disable all the network services that are not necessary for implementing the primary stated function. Some services may be a part of the Operating System or firmware and difficult or impractical to remove. If an unnecessary network service cannot be removed, disable it.If an unnecessary network service cannot be removed or disabled, document this network service and include an explanation of why it is running, i.e., &amp;#8220;It cannot be removed in an expedient manner.&amp;#8221; Consider implementing a mitigation measure to compensate for an unneeded, embedded network service, such as a firewall or a white list. The exact mitigation measure depends on the exact configuration and requires an expert opinion to be implemented correctly. Document the mitigation measures, if any.</p>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Update documentation.</strong> Document the primary function of the server and the features and applications used to implement it. </p>
        </li>
      </li>
