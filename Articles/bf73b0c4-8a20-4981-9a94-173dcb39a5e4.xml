* Web Applications Using Apache

==What to Check For==

Verify that Apache is configured to use only strong TLS ciphers.

==Why==

Using strong encryption algorithms with TLS helps reduce the risk of successful eavesdropping attacks and helps with regulatory compliance.

==How to Check==

To verify that Apache is configured to use only strong TLS ciphers, view the httpd.conf files and check the following settings: "SSLProtocol" and "SSLCipherSuite". The recommended settings are:

{{{

SSLProtocol -all +TLSv1
SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!aNULL:!SSLv2:!MD5:@STRENGTH
SSLHonorCipherOrder on

}}}

These settings enable only the TLS protocol and only the strong encryption cipher suites.

It may also be a good idea to check for the following line in case of old versions of apache/mod_ssl:

{{{

SSLInsecureRenegotiation off

}}}

==How to Fix==

To use only strong TLS algorithms, edit the httpd.conf file to include the following settings:

{{{

SSLProtocol -all +TLSv1
SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!aNULL:!SSLv2:!MD5:@STRENGTH
SSLHonorCipherOrder on

}}}

These settings enable only the TLS protocol and only the strong encryption cipher suites.

It may also be a good idea to include the following line in case of old versions of apache/mod_ssl:

{{{

SSLInsecureRenegotiation off

}}}
