==What to Check For==

Verify that SSL/TLS is used to protect Web Service connections.

==Why==

Protect Web Service connections using SSL/TLS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

==How to Check==

To verify that SSL/TLS is used to protect Web Service connections:

# **Make sure that valid certificates are present.** Examine the certificates that are present on the server that is hosting the Web Services. Make sure that the certificates are valid for that server.
# **Verify that SSL/TLS is configured on the server.** Examine the configuration of the server that is hosting the Web Services and make sure that Web Services are setup to only be acceptable over SSL/TLS encrypted connections.
# **Verify that client code connects to Web Services using SSL/TLS.** Examine the client-side code of the application that uses the Web Services. Make sure that the application only uses SSL/TLS protected connections to connect to the Web Services.

==How to Fix==

To use SSL/TLS to protect Web Service connections:

# **Get valid certificates.** Provision valid certificates for the server hosting the Web Services.
# **Set up SSL/TLS on the server.** Configure the server to use SSL/TLS for the Web Services. Don't allow unencrypted connections to the Web Services â€“ don't bind Web Services to ports that don't use SSL/TLS.
# **Update client code to use SSL/TLS.** Change client code to connect to the Web Services using the port that uses SSL/TLS.
