Protect sensitive data in transit over untrusted networks using TLS with valid certificates.


==Why==

Using TLS with valid certificates to protect sensitive data in transit prevents this data from being sniffed or tampered with. 


==What to Do==

To protect sensitive data in transit over untrusted networks using TLS:

# **Purchase valid TLS certificates.** You may purchase a valid TLS key from VeriSign, Thawte, or your web hosting provider. Follow the vendor's instructions for purchasing the TLS certificate. The certificate is usually a .cer file. Make sure the certificate matches all domains used by the application.
# **Identify code that sends data over untrusted networks.** It is more practical to secure all communications that to separate the communications that contain sensitive data from those that don't. Make a spreadsheet of all the code that uses networks to transmit data.
# **Use TLS to protect data in transit.** If the code that sends data over the network doesn't already, modify it to only use TLS sockets with valid certificates for network communications.]]></Data>
