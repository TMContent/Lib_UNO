==What to Check For==

Verify that session IDs are changed during login.

==Why==

Change session IDs during login to make sure that the session state corresponds to the authenticated user.

==How to Check==

To verify that session IDs are changed during login:

# **Find login functionality.** Find the code that is responsible for authentication.
# **Verify that session IDs are changed during login.** Review code responsible for logging in to make sure that code exists that clears the existing session state and creates a new session ID.

==How to Fix==

To change session IDs during login:

# **Find login functionality.** Find the code that is responsible for authentication.
# **Change session IDs during login.** Add code that invalidates the current session ID and creates a new one.
