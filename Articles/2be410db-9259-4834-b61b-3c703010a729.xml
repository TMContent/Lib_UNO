    <Data><![CDATA[==What to Check For==

Verify that all pages that use authentication have logout links.

==Why==

Placing a logout link on every page that requires authentication helps the user end the session when he is done with the site. Ending the session helps prevent hijacking.

==How to Check==

To verify that all pages that use authentication have logout links:

# **Identify all pages that use authentication.** Make a list of all pages on your site that use authentication.
# **Verify the presence of logout links.** Examine each page that uses authentication to make sure it has a logout link in a location that can be found intuitively.

==How to Fix==

To place a logout link on each page that uses authentication:

# **Identify all pages that use authentication.** Make a list of all pages on your site that use authentication.
# **Add logout links.** Add a logout link to each page that uses authentication.]]></Data>
