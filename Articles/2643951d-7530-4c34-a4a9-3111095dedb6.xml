  <p>Scala and Play Framework 2.1.0+<br /></p>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that your application enforces strong passwords.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Enforcing strong passwords minimizes the risk of a&amp;nbsp;Credentials Dictionary Attack&amp;nbsp;or guessing another user's password.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>To ensure that your application enforces strong passwords:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Identify password management routines.&amp;nbsp;</strong>Locate all routines inside your application that are responsible for managing user passwords. Potential areas to examine within your application include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Modifying accounts</li>
        <li>Creating new users</li>
        <li>Changing passwords</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Review your application's password policy.&amp;nbsp;</strong>Verify that your application provides a password policy. Ensure that the password policy addresses the following considerations that define a strong password:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Length</strong>: The policy provides length requirements for passwords. For example, require that a password must be at least 10 characters long.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Input Set</strong>: The policy provides requirements regarding the input set of passwords. For instance, a password must contain letters, numbers and special characters. If your organization has special restrictions for passwords,&amp;nbsp;verify that&amp;nbsp;the policy adopts these requirements. For example, require that a password must not match the user's&amp;nbsp;six previous passwords.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Expiration</strong>: The policy provides requirements for a password's lifetime. For example, require that a password will expire after 45 days.&amp;nbsp;</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Extra Requirements</strong>:&amp;nbsp;Enumerate&amp;nbsp;extra policy requirements for passwords, such as&amp;nbsp;a password must not be trivial and easily guessed.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Verify that the password policy is enforced.&amp;nbsp;</strong>Ensure that your application has implemented the password policy. Verify that all password management routines execute your application's implementation of the password policy before executing their own functionality. Example:</p>
      <pre>def addUser(username:String,pass:String ) = Action{ implicit request =&gt;      
      // Check if user exists in the user database
      // The application verifies that the given
      // password meets the password requirements
      if (!goodPassword(pass))
      {
            String errMsg = "User's password does not meet"
                           + " the password requirements";
            Ok(html.message.main(errMsg))
      }

      // Add user to the application's user database
      ...
}


  def goodPassword(pass:String ) = Action{ implicit request =&gt;  
{
      boolean alpha = false;
      boolean num = false;
      boolean sp = false;

      if (pass.length &lt; 10)
      {
            return false;
      }

      for (int i = 0; i &lt; pass.length; i++)
      {
            if (!alpha &amp;&amp; Character.isLetter(pass[i]))
            {
                  alpha = true;
            }

            if (!num &amp;&amp; Character.isDigit(pass[i]))
            {
                  num = true;
            }

            if (!sp &amp;&amp; (pass[i] == '!' ||
                  pass[i] == '@' || pass[i] == '#' ||
                  pass[i] == '$' || pass[i] == '%' ||
                  pass[i] == '^'))
            {
                  sp = true;
            }
      }

      return (alpha &amp; num) &amp; sp;
}</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong>&amp;nbsp;PCI DSS requirements state that passwords should be at least seven characters long, have both letters and numbers and&amp;nbsp;should expire after no more than 90 days.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p />
  <p>What constitutes a strong password varies from organization to organization. However, there are minimum requirements for length and input character sets. Minimum requirements for a strong password are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The password must be at least 10 characters long.</li>
    <li>It must contain letters, numbers, and special characters.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following steps are required for enforcing strong passwords:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Define password requirements.&amp;nbsp;</strong>Pick the schema that all passwords must follow. Check them for length and certain patterns. All passwords should be long (e.g. 10+ characters in length) and include a large input set (e.g. alpha-numeric and special character values).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Enforce password requirements.&amp;nbsp;</strong>The password requirements should be enforced while creating and modifying accounts.</li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enforce password lifetime.&amp;nbsp;</strong>Determine a lifetime of a password. Force the users to update their passwords on a given interval. Verify that the new password is different from the old password by comparing the produced hashes. Additionally users might be asked to not use previously used passwords.&amp;nbsp;</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
