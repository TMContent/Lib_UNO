Verify that authentication is required for all users.


==Why==

Require authentication for all users to prevent unauthorized access. If a user account is not protected with at least a password, an attacker will be able to easily use that account.


==How to Check==

To verify that authentication is required for all users:

# **Identify authentication code.** Make a spreadsheet about the code that implements authentication in the application.
# **Make sure authentication is required for all users.** Examine authentication code to verify that all user accounts require at least a password to login. Check for any special hard-coded user accounts that might not need credentials to login. These types of accounts should not be present.

==How to Fix==

To force authentication for all users:

# **Identify authentication code.** Make a spreadsheet about the code that implements authentication in the application.
# **Require authentication for all users.** If it doesn't already require authentication for all users, modify authentication code so that at least a password is required for successful authentication for all users. Remove code that implements any special hard-coded user accounts that don't require authentication.
