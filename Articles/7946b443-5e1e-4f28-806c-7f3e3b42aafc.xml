==What to Do==

Centralize authentication controls.

==Why==

Implementing a single set of centralized authentication controls helps implement them correctly, use them correctly in the application, and manage them later on.

==How==

To centralize authentication controls:

# **Identify application requirements.** Consider the following aspects of authentication controls:
## Authentication should be required for all private pages.
## All password fields should be masked.
## Accounts should be locked after multiple failed authentication attempts.
## Authentication should be implemented on the server-side.
## Authentication controls should be centralized.
## Authentication controls should fail securely.
## Strong authentication credentials (passwords) should be enforced.
## Account management functions should be protected.
## User credential (password) changing functions should be protected.
## Re-authentication should be required for sensitive operations.
## Authentication credentials (passwords) should expire.
## Authentication events should be logged.
## Authentication attempts should be throttled.
## Passwords should be hashed and salted.
## Authentication credentials (connection strings) for external resources should be protected.
## Authentication with external services.
# **Define authentication control APIs.** Make the exposed APIs simple to use for developers. Define authentication APIs to satisfy all application requirements. Include functionality to authenticate with external services.
# **Implement and document authentication controls.** Implement and document authentication APIs to satisfy all application requirements. 
# **Use authentication controls in the application.** Developers should use the centralized authentication controls whenever authentication is necessary.
