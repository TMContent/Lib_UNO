==What to Do==

Avoid using the HTTP-GET protocol to store sensitive data. 

==Why==

The HTTP-GET protocol because the protocol uses query strings to pass data. As query strings are clearly visible in the client's browser address bar, a malicious user can change the sensitive data that is clearly visible in the URL query string.  

==When==

When passing sensitive data over the network, make sure it is not using the HTTP-GET protocol. 

==How==

You should avoid storing sensitive data using the HTTP-GET protocol because the protocol uses query strings to pass data. Sensitive data cannot be secured using query strings and query strings are often logged by the server.
