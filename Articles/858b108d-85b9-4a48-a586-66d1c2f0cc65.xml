* Web Application

==What to Do==

Use only tested cryptographic services provided by your platform or web application framework.

==Why==

Developing cryptogaphic algorithms and the implementations of those algorithms is extremely difficult. Errors which are very hard to spot without a background in cryptanalysis can easily compromise security, while still appearing to be secure.  Because reference and system implementations are used by many applications, they're tested heavily by people with the appropriate background, ensuring a high level of dependability.

==When==

All systems which use encryption should use standard implementations and algorithms.

==How==

All platforms provide standard cryptographic libraries, often available as services inside the platform or host operating system. Use those services according to their documentation, taking into account what properties a given algorithm or API can and cannot supply.]]></Data>
