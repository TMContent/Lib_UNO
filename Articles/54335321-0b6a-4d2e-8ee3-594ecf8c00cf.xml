==What to Check For==

Verify that object references that are passed as parameters to functions are checked for null before being used.

==Why==

Check function parameters for null before using them to prevent your application from crashing if it tries to use that parameter as an object.

==How to Check==

To verify that object references that are passed as parameters to functions are checked for null before being used:

# **Identify all functions that accept object references as parameters.** Make a spreadsheet of all functions that accept object references as parameters. Most functions in your application will probably be in that spreadsheet and that is okay.
# **Verify that object references that are passed as parameters are validated.** Examine each function that accepts object references as parameters. Verify that each object reference is checked for null before being used as an object. If a function is passed null as a parameter instead of an object, the function should either throw an exception or simply not use that parameter as an object.

==How to Fix==

To check function parameters for null before using them:

# **Identify all functions that accept object references as parameters.** Make a spreadsheet of all functions that accept object references as parameters. Most functions in your application will probably be in that spreadsheet and that is okay.
# **Update all functions that accept object references as parameters to check parameters for null.** At the beginning of each function that accepts object references, add code to check each reference for null. If a function is passed null as a parameter instead of an object, the function should either throw an exception or simply not use that parameter as an object.
