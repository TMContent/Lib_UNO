==What to Check For==

Verify that exceptions are caught.

==Why==

If you allow exception details to propagate from your Web applications back to the client, then a malicious user could use system-level diagnostic information to learn about your application and probe for weaknesses to exploit in future attacks.

==How to Check==

Review the application to make sure that all code that might fail is either enclosed in a try/catch/finally block or caught by a global exception handler. Ideally, exceptions should be caught close to the source, because then it is easier to write error messages that improve the user experience and provide useful debugging information.

==How to Fix==

Use structured exception handling and catch exception conditions. Doing so avoids leaving your application in an inconsistent state that may lead to information disclosure. It also helps protect your application from denial of service attacks. Decide how to propagate exceptions internally in your application and give special consideration to what occurs at the application boundary.
