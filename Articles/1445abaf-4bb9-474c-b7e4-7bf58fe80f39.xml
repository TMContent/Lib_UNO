* HTML5

==What to Do==

URL-encode data that gets included in HTTP response headers. 

==Why==

Data in HTTP response headers should be URL-encoded to prevent response-splitting vulnerabilities. 

==How==

To URL-encode data in HTTP Response headers: 

# **Identify all data included in HTTP response headers.** Identify the functions that are provided by your platform to include data in HTTP response headers. Search your code for calls to these functions in order to find all code that adds data to HTTP response headers.
# **Validate all data included in HTTP response headers.** Use positive validation routines to check all data that gets included in HTTP response headers.
# **URL-encode all data included in HTTP response headers.** Identify the functions that are provided by your platform to URL-encode data. Use these functions to URL-encode data that gets included in HTTP response headers.
