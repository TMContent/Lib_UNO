    <Data><![CDATA[==Applies To==

* PCI DSS Requirement 3.2.1

==Policy Statement==

Do not store full track contents.

==Policy Purpose==

The full card track contents should not be stored to limit the potential damage in the event of a successful attack. The term "track contents" refers to the information stored on the magnetic strip of the physical card issued to a cardholder. New cards also include a chip, the contents of which should also be considered "track contents." If an attacker has this information, he may be able to use it to make fraudulent transactions; therefore, the full track contents should never be stored.
