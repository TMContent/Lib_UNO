    <Data><![CDATA[==Description==

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a widely used protocol for accessing directory services. Directories provide a set of attributes about people that are organized in a hierarchical manner.  LDAP Injection is a technique to exploit applications that use input from users to query an LDAP directory. LDAP injection has the potential to view, modify, or remove personal information about anyone in the directory. LDAP Injection applies to all applications that use LDAP. 


==Impact==

LDAP injection allows an attacker to access and/or modify restricted data in the LDAP database. The attacker might leverage this vulnerability to view personal information of users in the database. The attacker can also leverage this vulnerability to give themselves administrative privileges or to take over another account. Once the attacker has administrative privileges, they usually have full control of the application. 


==Countermeasures==

To prevent LDAP injection, validate all input.

==Application Check==

To check for adequate protection against this vulnerability, find all code that queries directories and verify that data included in the queries is sufficiently validated.
