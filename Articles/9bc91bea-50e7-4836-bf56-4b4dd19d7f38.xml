A public area of your site can be accessed by any user anonymously. Restricted areas can be accessed only by specific individuals and the users must authenticate with the site. Consider a typical retail Web site. You can browse the product catalog anonymously. When you add items to a shopping cart, the application identifies you with a session identifier. Finally, when you place an order, you perform a secure transaction. This requires you to log in to authenticate your transaction over SSL.

By partitioning your site into public and restricted access areas, you can apply separate authentication and authorization rules across the site and limit the use of SSL. To avoid the unnecessary performance overhead associated with SSL, design your site to limit the use of SSL to the areas that require authenticated access.]]></Data>
