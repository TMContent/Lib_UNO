Verify that authentication controls are implemented on the server-side.

## Why ##

Server-side authentication should be used because client-side authentication is trivial to bypass.

## How to Check ##

To verify that server-side authentication is used:

1. **Identify authentication controls.** Find code that is responsible for authentication.
2. **Verify that authentication controls are implemented on the server.** Review authentication code to make sure that authentication is performed on the server.


## How to Fix ##

1. **Define authentication requirements.** Consider the following aspects of authentication control as they pertain to your application:
 - Enforcing password strength requirements.
 - Allowing secure password reset or recovery.
 - Requiring re-authentication for sensitive operations.
 - Using multi-factor authentication.
 - Using simple error messages that don't give away information to the attacker.
 - Using TLS to secure communications.
 - Throttling repeated authentication attempts.
 - Locking inactive authentication accounts.
2. **Implement authentication on the server.** It is important to implement security controls such as authentication on the server, because an attacker can tamper with client-side security controls or disable them altogether. Implement authentication controls that match the requirements defined in the previous step on the server back-end.
3. **Add client-side code that authenticates to the server.** Once authentication is implemented in accordance with the requirements, add client-side code that authenticates to the server. The client-side code will need:
 - An interface for managing authentication credentials.
 - Network code that communicates with the server using TLS.
 - A token or some other means to maintain session state on the server, and possibly secure storage for cached authentication credentials.]]></Data>
