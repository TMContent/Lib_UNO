==What to Check For==

Verify that authentication and authorization are required for all sensitive pages.

==Why==

All pages that have private information should require authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized information disclosure. Use role-based authorization policies because they are relatively simple to manage correctly.

==How to Check==

To verify that authentication and authorization are required for all sensitive pages:

# **Identify all sensitive pages.** Make a list of all pages that handle sensitive or private information.
# **Verify that all sensitive pages require authentication.** Visit each sensitive page with a web browser to make sure it requires authentication.

==How to Fix==

To require authentication for all private resources:

# **Identify all sensitive pages.** Make a list of all pages that handle sensitive or private information.
# **Define roles.** Define access roles for your application. These roles should include administrative users and various types of users specific to your application.
# **Implement authentication.** Implement and document authentication APIs to satisfy all application requirements.
# **Require authentication for all sensitive pages.** Add code to all sensitive pages that checks if the user is authenticated and authorized to view them.
