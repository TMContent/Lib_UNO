    <Data><![CDATA[## What to Do ##

Maintain backups.


## Why ##

Maintain backups to prevent data losses and to accelerate recovery in the event of compromise.


## How ##

To maintain backups:

1. **Identify important data.** Make a spreadsheet about the data that needs to be backed up.

2. **Determine backup storage requirements.** Determine if there are compliance requirements for storing backups.

3. **Define backup schedule.** Determine when backups are made and how. An automated system is usually used to create backups according to the schedule. The more data to backup, the more prudent it is to automate the process.

4. **Implement the backup system.** Deploy and configure the hardware and the software required to implement the backup solution. It is highly recommended to encrypt the backups, which will then also require implementing key management.

5. **Maintain backup inventory.** Keep track of backups once they have been created to make sure that they are available and have not been compromised.
