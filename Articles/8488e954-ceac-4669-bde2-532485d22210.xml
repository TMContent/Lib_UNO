Remove test data before deployment. 


==Why==

Remove test data from the application before deployment. This data may disclose information about the workings of the application and may assist attackers with compromising the system.


==How==

To remove test data from the application before deployment:

# **Identify data stores used by the application.** Make a spreadsheet of all the places that are used by the application to store data.
# **Examine data stores used by the application.** Before deploying the application, examine each place where the application stores data and check for the presence of test data.
# **Remove all test data from the application.** Remove any test data that has been found before deploying the application.
