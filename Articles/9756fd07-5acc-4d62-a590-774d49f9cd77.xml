Remove all test accounts from applications before deployment.


==Why==

Test accounts provide access to the application's functionality during development. Since they are often poorly secured, they are a common target for attackers.


==How==

To remove all test accounts from applications before deployment:

# **Enumerate all accounts.** List all the users to your application. This should be a full comprehensive list that includes, but is not limited to, active users, inactive users, users pending confirmation, and test accounts.
# **Identify their use.** Examine the use/status of each account. Sort the accounts into groups according to their use/status.
# **Remove the accounts that will no longer be used.** Once the accounts are sorted into groups, list all accounts that are used for test purposes. After identifying all test accounts, remove them from your application's database.
# **Enforce strong passwords on the remaining accounts.** After removing all test accounts, enforce strong passwords for the remaining accounts in your application. Strong passwords decrease the probability of compromising valid users.
