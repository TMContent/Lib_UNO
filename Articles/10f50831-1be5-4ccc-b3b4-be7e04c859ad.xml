    <Data><![CDATA[## What to Do ##

Load additional code carefully.

## Why ##

Load additional code carefully to prevent attackers from injecting malicious code.

## How ##

To load code carefully:

1. **Identify code that loads additional code.** Make a spreadsheet about all code being loaded by the application.

2. **Validate any user data used to determine what code to load.** It's not a good idea to load code based on user input. However, if it is necessary, then at least validate the user data before using it to load code.

3. **Validate the source of the code being loaded.** Use white-lists to determine the trusted sources of code before loading anything. Cryptographic signatures can also be used to identify trusted code.
