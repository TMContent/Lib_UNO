    <Data><![CDATA[## What to Do ##

Use valid TLS certificates.

## Why ##

Using valid TLS certificates helps prevent many types of man-in-the-middle attacks.

## How ##

To use a valid TLS certificate:

1. **Purchase a valid TLS certificate.** You may purchase a valid TLS key from a Certificate Authority. The certificate is usually a .cer file. Make sure the certificate matches all domains used by the application.
2. **Be aware of certificate expiration.** TLS certificates expire and have to be renewed to remain valid. Make note of when the certificate is going to expire and plan to renew it before the expiration date.
3. **Import the valid TLS certificate.** The exact instructions for importing TLS certificates are different for different platforms. Refer to your platform's documentation or technical support for detailed instructions on how to use TLS certificates.
