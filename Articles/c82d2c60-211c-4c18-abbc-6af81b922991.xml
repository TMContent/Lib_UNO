    <Data><![CDATA[==What to Do==

Log events associated with the logging subsystem, such as the beginning and the end of logging.

==Why==

Log events such as the initialization of the logging subsystem to help detect when logs have been stopped to conceal malicious activity.

==How==

To log events associated with the logging subsystem:

# **Identify code used to start and stop logging.** Make a spreadsheet of code that initializes, pauses, or stops logging. This code should naturally be a part of the logging subsystem itself, so it should be easy to find.
# **Add code that generates log entries.** To each piece of code that starts or stops logging, add code that generates log entries indicating that the logging subsystem has been started or stopped.
