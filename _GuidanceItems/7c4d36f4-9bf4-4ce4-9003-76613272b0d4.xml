  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Penetration tests should be performed at least once a year and after any significant changes to the network.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Penetration tests may expose security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Penetration tests exercise the response capabilities of the company to verify that they are sufficient for handling an actual attack.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Use the following steps to check if penetration tests are performed regularly:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Review policy.</strong> Examine the information security policy to verify that it requires:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Penetration tests to be performed at least once a year and after any significant changes to the network
</li>
        <li>All found vulnerabilities to be fixed </li>
        <li>Tests to be repeated until no more vulnerabilities are found</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Review Documentation. </strong>Examine the results of the previous penetration tests to verify that they have been performed regularly and the discovered vulnerabilities were corrected.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Perform the following tasks to assure that penetration tests are performed regularly:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Update policy.</strong> Add&amp;nbsp;requirements to the information security policy to
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conduct penetration tests at least once a year&amp;nbsp;and after any significant changes to the network
</li>
        <li>Fix all found vulnerabilities </li>
        <li>Repeat testing until no more vulnerabilities are found</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Schedule penetration tests.</strong> Hire a qualified company to perform penetration tests. Perform penetration tests regularly, document the results, and attach them to the security documentation.</p>
    </li>
