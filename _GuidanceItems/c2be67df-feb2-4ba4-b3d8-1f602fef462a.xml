    <Data><![CDATA[<h1>Applies to</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 6.3</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Assign different responsibilities to the staff in the development environment and the staff in the production environment.
</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Keeping the staff responsibilities separate helps maintain the separation of the production and testing environments.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>If a development environment does not exist already, create it. If a development environment has been a part of the production environment, remove all development elements from the production environment. The development staff should be separate from the
 people working in the production environment. The personnel working in the production environment should not be concerned with development tasks.</p>]]></Data>
