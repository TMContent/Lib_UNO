Verify that application updates are signed.

==Why==

Cryptographically signing applications assures that the application binary has not been tampered with and that it came from a trusted source. In practice, updates to iOS applications are distributed as full new versions rather than patches. iOS application updates have to be signed to run, just like entirely new applications have to be signed. 

==How to Check==

Updated applications will not run if they are not signed properly. To verify that an application update is signed:

# **Install the application update.** Follow the standard procedure to install the application update. Usually, this means installing the application update via iTunes.
# **Run the application.** Once the application update is installed, launch the application from the Springboard. If the application runs, then the update has been signed successfully.

==How to Fix==

The procedure for signing iOS application updates is the same as the procedure for signing iOS applications in general.
