  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Designate at least one DMZ. A DMZ is a network segment that contains machines that may handle incoming Internet traffic. There may be more than one DMZ.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The DMZ is a defense-in-depth measure used to separate systems that are open to attacks from those that hold sensitive information. When a DMZ is implemented, even if the systems in the DMZ are compromised, the attacker does not have full access to the sensitive
 information.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Designate a network segment as the DMZ. Install and configure a firewall between the DMZ and the Internet. Install and configure a firewall between the DMZ and the internal network segment. Document the network. For more information about setting up a DMZ,
 please refer to the article, “Configure the Routers for PCI DSS Compliance".</p>]]></Data>
