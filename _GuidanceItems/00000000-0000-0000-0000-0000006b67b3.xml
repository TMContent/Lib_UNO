* iOS applications that send or receive sensitive data over the network.

==What to Check For==

Verify that strong TLS configurations are used.

==Why==

Using strong TLS configurations prevents eavesdropping and other man-in-the-middle attacks. iOS TLS configurations are relatively strong by default, depending on the SDK version, and need to be intentionally degraded to be unsafe. Unfortunately, many developers degrade iOS TLS strength for compatibility with the development environments and subsequently do not restore the TLS configuration to the secure defaults in the production releases.

==How to Check==

To verify that strong TLS configurations are used:

# **Verify that self-signed certificates are disabled.** Search application code for the presence of the //continueWithoutCredentialForAuthenticationChallenge// selector - the presence of this selector indicates that self-signed TLS certificates may be allowed.
# **Check the available SDK version.** Identify the iOS SDK version used by the application. Versions 5 and higher of the iOS SDK use strong TLS cipher suites. There are no practical ways to control which cipher suites are used by iOS applications. If strength of TLS ciphers is a critical requirement, use version 5 or higher of the iOS SDK.

==How to Fix==

To use strong TLS configurations:

# **Disable self-signed certificates.** Self-signed certificates are disabled by default by the iOS SDK. Developers have to intentionally enable self-signed certificates for the application to accept them. Self-signed certificates are often enabled for testing in the development environment. It is important to disable self-signed certificates in production releases, because self-signed certificates allow man-in-the-middle attacks, which largely negate the benefits of TLS.
# **Identify the available SDK version.** Identify the iOS SDK version used by the application.
# **Use iOS SDK version 5 or higher.** The cipher suites used by TLS implementations in iOS SDKs vary by version. Versions 5 and higher of the iOS SDK use strong TLS cipher suites. There are no practical ways to control which cipher suites are used by iOS applications. If strength of TLS ciphers is a critical requirement, use version 5 or higher of the iOS SDK.
