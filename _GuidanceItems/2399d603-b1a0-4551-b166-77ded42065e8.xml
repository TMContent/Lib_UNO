* iOS applications that handle XML documents.

==What to Check For==

Verify that data inserted into XML documents is validated and encoded.

==Why==

Validating and encoding data inserted into XML documents helps prevent XML injection vulnerabilities.

==How to Check==

To verify that data inserted into XML documents is validated and encoded:

# **Identify XML documents used by the application.** Examine the application design to identify all XML documents and XML document types used by the application.
# **Identify code that handles XML documents.** Find all application code that handles XML documents.
# **Review validation methods.** Make sure that clear validation methods are defined for each type of XML data handled by the application.
# **Review encoding methods.** Make sure that encoding methods are defined for XML data. Consider the following when evaluating XML encoding: 
#* Data must first be converted to a uniform character encoding. 
#* XML entities must be escaped properly. 
#* Code that loads XML documents must be able to restore the original data from the encoded data.
# **Verify that validation and encoding are used.** Make sure that all XML data is validated and encoded before it is inserted into XML documents.

==How to Fix==

To validate and encode data inserted into XML documents:

# **Identify XML documents used by the application.** Examine the application design to identify all XML documents and XML document types used by the application.
# **Identify code that handles XML documents.** Find all application code that handles XML documents.
# **Write data validation methods.** Write methods that validate all the data types that are stored in XML documents and used by the application.
# **Use validation methods.** Call the data validation methods from the previous step wherever the application handles XML documents. Validation should be performed before encoding.
# **Write encoding methods.** Write methods that escape XML entities. Unfortunately, there are no stable libraries available for escaping XML entities for iOS. When writing code that escapes XML entities, consider the following: 
#* Data must first be converted to a uniform character encoding. 
#* XML entities must be escaped properly.
#* Code that loads XML documents must be able to restore the original data from the encoded data.
# **Use encoding methods.** Call the encoding methods from the previous step wherever the application handles XML documents.
