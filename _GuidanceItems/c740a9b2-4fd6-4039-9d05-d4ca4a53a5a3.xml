  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>The system configuration standards should include common security settings.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Including common security settings in the system configuration standards helps make sure that the security settings are consistent across the network.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Examine the system configuration standards to make sure they include common security settings. The common security settings should reflect the features and capabilities of the target system. For example, if a device supports VPN, then the VPN settings should
 be included in the system configuration standards when relevant.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Identify each type of system on the network. For each type of system, identify security features and configuration options it provides.&amp;nbsp;Decide on the appropriate settings for the security features and capabilities of each system type. Document the chosen
 settings of the security features of each type of system in the system configuration standards.</p>
