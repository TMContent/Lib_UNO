* Java


==What to Do==

Multiple threads within a servlet session may have access to the same //HttpSession// objects. Avoid using instance and static class variables and always consider thread safety during object initialization or modification.


==Why==

Improper handling of //HttpSession// objects can lead to race conditions and concurrency issues.


==How==

To ensure thread safety:

# **Identify all //HttpSession// objects that may be modified by multiple threads.** Find all code that modifies //HttpSession// objects, which may be accessed by multiple threads. One approach is to search code for the //HttpSession// keyword and then trace each //HttpSession// object throughout the code.
# **Use immutable objects as much as possible.** Using immutable objects is a sound practice for avoiding concurrency issues and should be used as much as possible. The specifics of using immutable objects are different for different applications.
# **Use class methods and local variables data handling.** For each piece of code that modifies //HttpSession// objects, use "thread-safe" class methods and local variables if possible. 
# **Synchronize critical sections that must be executed as a single operation.** For complex operations on //HttpSession// objects, make sure that critical sections are synchronized.


==Problem Example==

A shopping cart has a Pay Now button that finalizes a purchase and charges the customerâ€™s credit card. An application that is not thread safe may allow for a user to double-click the button and charge the customer twice for the same transaction.


==Solution Example==

Synchronized critical sections or immutable objects both can help prevent concurrency issues that might lead to simultaneous credit card transactions.
