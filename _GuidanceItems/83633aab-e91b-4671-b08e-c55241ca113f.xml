  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Apply system configuration standards to new systems before they are deployed.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The purpose of having system configuration standards is to make sure that all systems have secure configurations from the time they are deployed. To fulfill the purpose of the system configuration standards, they should be applied when new systems are being
 configured.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Make sure that system configuration standards are available for all network device types. Designate staff to be responsible for configuring new systems. Instruct the staff responsible for configuring new systems to apply the system configuration standards
 when new systems are configured. Add a point to the information security policy stating that the system configuration standards must be applied when new systems are configured.</p>]]></Data>
