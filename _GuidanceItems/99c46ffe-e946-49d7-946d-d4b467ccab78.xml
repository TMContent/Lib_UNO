  <p>Designate several staff members as key custodians. Have them study the relevant parts of the information security policy and key management procedures. Interview the key custodians to verify that they understand their responsibilities. Prepare a form for
 the key custodians to sign to acknowledge that they accept responsibility for the keys. Have the key custodians sign the forms. Include a blank copy of the form in the information security policy and the signed forms in the network documentation.</p>]]></Data>
