    <Data><![CDATA[==Applies To==

*iOS applications that authenticate to a remote server.

==What to Do==

Throttle authentication attempts by making authentication code pause for a few seconds between authentication requests from the same IP.

==Why==

Throttle authentication attempts to make password guessing attacks less effective. Authentication throttling should be implemented on the server to be effective.

==How==

To throttle authentication attempts:

# **Define authentication throttling requirements.** Define the time-out period between authentication attempts. A recommended time-out period is three seconds.
# **Identify authentication code.** Identify server-side code that is responsible for authentication.
# **Add code that throttles authentication attempts.** Edit the authentication code identified in the previous step to wait for the required time period before handling another authentication request. Keep track of clients using IPs and session cookies to make it harder to bypass authentication throttling.
