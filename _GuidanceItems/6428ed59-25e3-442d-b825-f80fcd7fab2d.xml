  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Ensure that public-facing web applications are reviewed using manual or automated tools or methods at least annually and after any changes. Check that an organization or department that specializes in application security performs the review. Verify that
 all vulnerabilities found during the review are corrected. Check that the applications are re-evaluated after the corrections.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Reviewing public-facing web applications may help discover and fix vulnerabilities before they are discovered and exploited by attackers.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Make sure that the review process is documented. Inspect the review documentation to make sure the reviews are performed using manual or automated tools or methods at least annually or after any changes. Verify that the review is performed by an organization
 or department that specializes in application security. Review the documentation to make sure that all discovered vulnerabilities are corrected and the applications are re-evaluated after the corrections.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
