* HTML5

==What to Do==

Use the Strict-Transport-Security response header to enforce secure communication with the browser via HTTPS. This header is often referred to as HTTP Strict Transport Security, or simply HSTS.

==Why==

The Strict-Transport-Security header instructs the browser to communicate with the server only via HTTPS, a secure communication tunnel that prevents eavesdropping. Without the header, there is no way for the browser to “know” that a web page should be accessed over HTTPS. This leaves open the possibility of using standard, unencrypted HTTP whether through a malicious link or direct URL access. 

==When==

Use this guideline when implementing HTML5 web applications that transmit confidential data.

==How==

Note that, as of this writing, the latest releases of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Opera all support the HSTS header. However, Internet Explorer does not.

# **Enable the //mod_header// module in the //httpd.conf// configuration file (if it is not already enabled).** For example, if you are using Apache Web Server, first enable
//LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so//
# **Add the HSTS header to the //httpd.conf// configuration file.** Include the required directive //max-age//. This specifies the time, in seconds, that a compliant browser will abide by forced HTTPS, even in the event a standard HTTP connection is attempted. For example, in the Apache //httpd.conf// configuration file, add the following line: //Header always append Strict-Transport-Security: "max-age=7776000"//. This directive instructs the browser to connect only via HTTPS for the next 90 days. The server will inject this header information into each application page rendered.
# **Reload or restart the web server configuration.** The first time the user connects to your website using HTTPS, the browser reads the HSTS header, including the //max-age// directive. The browser will know it should connect only via HTTPS for the specified //max-age// time period.

==Problem Example==

Example.com is a popular stock-trading site that handles confidential financial information for its users. In this scenario, it is the intention that all requests from users are sent using HTTPS. However, no Strict-Transport-Security response header is sent from the Example.com server.

A hacker at a coffee shop uses his laptop to intercept all unencrypted traffic on the local wireless network. A user visits the coffee shop, and clicks a link to log in to the secure Example.com website. However, the link is http://www.example.com/login.php instead of https://www.example.com/login.php. Though the user is visiting the correct website, the hacker can eavesdrop, because the communication tunnel is unencrypted.

{{{

<a href="http://www.example.com/login.php"> Click here </a> to login securely connect to example.com

}}}

Even though the verbiage indicates a secure connection, the hyperlink clearly is not secure.

==Solution Example==

To correct the situation, the developers at Example.com include the Strict-Transport-Security response header. In the configuration file of their Apache 2 server, they enable //mod_header//, and then add:

{{{

Header always append Strict-Transport-Security: "max-age=7776000 " 

}}}

Assuming that the user has logged in previously to Example.com, the browser will now detect that the connection should be HTTPS and connect securely.
