==What to Do==

Set //HTTPOnly// and //Secure// flags on session cookies.

==Why==

The //Secure// flag should be set on session cookie to protect its contents from eavesdropping attacks.  These attacks, if successful, can be used to hijack the userâ€™s session and interact with the application as if they were the real user. Setting the //Secure// flag on session cookie ensures it is only transferred over connections that are secured by SSL and prevents eavesdropping.

The //HTTPOnly// flag should be set on session cookie to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting attacks. Setting the //HTTPOnly// flag on session cookie prevents the contents of the cookie from being transmitted by a client-side script. Since in a Cross-Site Scripting attack  an arbitrary script runs in the context of the user's browser, the //HTTPOnly// flag effectively prevents the malicious script from using the cookie in the attack.

==How==

To set //HTTPOnly// and //Secure// flags on session cookies:

# **Configure IIS to use SSL/TLS.** Get a valid certificate. Hosting service providers often sell valid SSL certificates. Install the certificate. Create an HTTPS binding for the site. A link in the "Additional Resources" section describes how to do this in detail.
# **Set the Secure and HTTPOnly flags for session cookies.** Edit the Web.config file. Set the //httpOnlyCookies// property to //true// for the //httpCookies// element. Set the //requireSSL// property to //true// for the //httpCookies// element. There are different ways to write this in XML. Here is one: <httpcookies httponlycookies="true" requiressl="true"></httpcookies>
