==What to Check For==

Verify that code integrity checks are implemented.

==Why==

Code integrity checks help prevent software piracy and unauthorized modifications to the application. Code integrity checks do not provide 100% assurance of code integrity, but they make it harder for an attacker to modify the application binary code without breaking it.

==How to Check==

To verify that code integrity checks are implemented:

# **Identify piracy check functions.** It's best if someone knows whether piracy checks exist and where they are. Otherwise it might be necessary to examine each function individually to determine its purpose.
# **Identify integrity check functions.** It's best if someone knows whether integrity checks exist and where they are. Otherwise it might be necessary to examine each function individually to determine its purpose.
# **Verify that integrity check functions protect piracy check functions.** Find calls to the piracy check functions and make sure that integrity check functions are also called to verify that piracy check functions have not been tampered with.
# **Verify that piracy check and integrity check functions are scattered throughout the application.** Find calls to the piracy and integrity check functions to make sure they are called multiple times throughout the application.


==How to Fix==

To check code for integrity:

# **Write piracy check functions.** Piracy check functions often try to determine whether the application is running on a jailbroken device. The application is not necessarily pirated if it is on a jailbroken device, but there are no foolproof anti-piracy or code integrity measures for jailbroken devices. Piracy checks can determine whether a device is jailbroken by checking for the existence of files that only appear on jailbroken devices, such as Cydia. If piracy is not a concern, this step may be omitted.
# **Write integrity check functions.** The most common ways to implement code integrity checks is to check classes for expected addresses or checksums. The //class_getMethodImplementation// method returns a pointer to a method; checking the value of this pointer against the expected value provides reasonable assurance that the method has not been modified during runtime.
# **Define integrity check functions as inline.** The integrity check functions written in the previous step should be defined as //inline// so that the compiler inserts the full integrity checking code wherever it is invoked.
# **Scatter integrity check functions throughout the application.** Multiple integrity check function calls spread out throughout the application make it harder for an attacker to find them all and patch them.
