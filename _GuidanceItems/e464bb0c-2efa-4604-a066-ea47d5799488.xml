  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 1.1.3</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Each Internet connection should be secured by a firewall.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Allowing unfiltered Internet access to the network gives attackers more opportunities to exploit potential vulnerabilities and to control potentially compromised systems remotely.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Verify that the security policy includes a point that requires there has to be a firewall at each internet connection. Verify that the current network diagram is consistent with the PCI DSS firewall configuration standards.&amp;nbsp;Check each Internet connection
 and make sure it is secured by a firewall.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>If an Internet connection is not secured by a firewall, install and configure a firewall on that Internet connection. Update the security policy to include the requirement that there has to be a firewall at each internet connection. Update the network diagram
 to include any new firewalls.</p>
