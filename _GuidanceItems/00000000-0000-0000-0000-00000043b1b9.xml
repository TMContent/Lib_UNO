==What to Check For==

Verify that data in HTTP response headers is URL-encoded.

==Why==

Data in HTTP response headers should be URL-encoded to prevent response splitting vulnerabilities.

==How to Check==

To verify that data in HTTP response headers is URL-encoded:

# **Identify all data included in HTTP response headers.** Search your code for calls to //setHeader// to find all code that adds data to HTTP response headers.
# **Verify that data included in HTTP response headers is validated.** Examine code that adds data to response headers. Make sure that any user data is passed through positive validation routines before being included in HTTP response headers.
# **Verify that data included in HTTP response headers is URL-encoded.** Examine code that adds data to response headers. Make sure that any user data is URL-encoded using the //URLEncoder.encode// function before being included in HTTP response headers.

==How==

To URL-encode data in HTTP Response headers:

# **Identify all data included in HTTP response headers.** Search your code for calls to //setHeader// to find all code that adds data to HTTP response headers.
# **Validate all data included in HTTP response headers.** Use positive validation routines to check all data that gets included in HTTP response headers.
# **URL-encode all data included in HTTP response headers.** Use the //URLEncoder.encode// method to URL-encode data that gets includes in HTTP response headers.
