==What to Check For==

Ensure that TCP connections are not tunneled via WebSockets. Instead, those connections are made through standard TCP ports. 

==Why==

Do not use WebSockets to tunnel TCP connections for several reasons:
* Web proxies may not necessarily support the WebSockets upgrade to the HTTP port protocol.
* Tunneling non-HTTP and non-HTTPS traffic through ports 80 and 443 will circumvent firewall rules that may be in place for a larger reason. If you offer support for TCP tunneling by turning your web server into a network proxy, you may undermine standard security infrastructure, such as firewalls and secure gateways.
* Data sent through tunneled TCP connections via WebSockets may not be securely transmittedâ€”particularly if the connection is sent via {{{ws://}}} rather than {{{wss://}}}. The WebSockets connection may not employ the same security and care as the standard TCP connection. This could expose the connection to eavesdropping or other exploits.

==How To Check==

To verify that TCP connections are not tunneled via WebSockets:

# **Find instances of code that uses WebSockets.** Look for instances where a WebSocket is created, such as: {{{var socket = new WebSocket(url);}}}
# **Review the code to ensure the code is not used for tunneling TCP connections.** Look for any code that uses a port that is not 80 or 443. Also look for code that uses TCP sockets, such as the //Socket// object.

==How To Fix==

Perform a thorough review of your applications and remove instances of TCP tunneling if you find any in the review. To perform the review, follow these steps:

# **Find instances of code that uses WebSockets.** Look for instances where a WebSocket is created, such as: {{{var socket = new WebSocket(url);}}}
# **Review the code to ensure the code is not used for tunneling TCP connections.** Look for any code that uses a port that is not 80 or 443. Also look for code that uses TCP sockets, such as the {{{Socket}}} object.
# **Remove code that performs tunneling.** If you find any code that you suspect of TCP tunneling, remove the offending code from the application.
# **If tunneling is necessary, replace the tunneling with secure techniques such as VPN (virtual private networking).** Use industry-standard mechanisms for providing access to required services. Define and implement access policies that use these mechanisms.
