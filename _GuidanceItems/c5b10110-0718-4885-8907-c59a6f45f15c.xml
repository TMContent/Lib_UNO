==What to Check For==

Verify that session cookies are sent only using SSL/TLS.

==Why==

If session identifiers are transmitted in plain-text, an attacker can intercept them using a man-in-the-middle attack. After intercepting a session identifier, the attacker can hijack the corresponding session. Hijacking a session allows the attacker to carry out any action that is available to the authenticated user. To prevent session identifiers from being sent in plain-text, session cookies should be sent only using SSL/TLS.

==How to Check==

To verify that session cookies are sent only using SSL/TLS:

# **Load the application and authenticate.** Open the application with a web browser and authenticate. It's okay to start the session in some other way and many applications will create sessions even for users that aren't authenticated. Logging in is a certain way to start a session for any reasonably designed application that uses sessions. Make sure that the application uses SSL - most browsers indicate that with an icon in the URL bar.
# **Examine the session cookies.** Use a web browser option or plugin that shows detailed information about the current cookies. Examine the session cookie created by the application. Make sure that it has the //HTTPOnly// and //Secure// flags set.
# **Examine Web.config.** Review the Web.config configuration file to make sure that //httpOnlyCookies// and //requireSSL// properties are set to //true// for the //httpCookies// element. These settings will actually set //HTTPOnly// and //Secure// flags for all cookies, which is not strictly required to pass this checklist, but these settings are recommended.

==How to Fix==

To send session cookies only using SSL/TLS:

# **Configure IIS to use SSL/TLS.** Get a valid certificate. Hosting service providers often sell valid SSL certificates. Install the certificate. Create an HTTPS binding for the site. A link in the "Additional Resources" section describes how to do this in detail.
# **Set the //Secure// flag on cookies.** Set the //requireSSL// property to //true// for the //httpCookies// element in the web.config file, like this: <httpcookies requiressl="true"></httpcookies> If you use Forms Authentication, you will also need to set //requireSSL// to //true// for the //forms// element.
