    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 1.1.3</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>A firewall should be separating the DMZ and the internal network segment.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The DMZ has Internet connectivity and is therefore subject to attack. In the event that machines in the DMZ are compromised, the firewall should protect the cardholder data environment from the DMZ. Installing a firewall between the DMZ and the cardholder
 data environment is a defense-in-depth measure - it offers an extra layer of security in the event that some of the network is compromised.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Check the physical network wiring to make sure there is a firewall installed between the DMZ and the internal network segment. Check the firewall configuration of the DMZ firewall to make sure that it is actively filtering traffic between the DMZ and the
 internal network segment. Check the network diagram in the network documentation to make sure it includes a firewall between the DMZ and the cardholder data environment.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Install a firewall between the DMZ and the cardholder data environment. Install a firewall between the DMZ and any other internal network segment. Configure the firewalls in accordance with the firewall configuration standards, found in the link below. Add
 any new firewalls to the network diagram in the network documentation. </p>
