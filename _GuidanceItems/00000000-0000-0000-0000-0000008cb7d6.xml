    <Data><![CDATA[==Applies To==

* iOS applications that handle sensitive data.

==What to Check For==

Verify that sensitive data is not cached.

==Why==

Data from temporary files may be recovered by an attacker if the device is lost or compromised.

==How to Check==

To verify that sensitive data is not cached:

# **Identify sensitive data.** Make a list of all sensitive information handled by your application. Some examples are:
#* Passwords
#* Encryption keys
#* Personal information
# **Identify code that creates temporary files used by the application.** Review the application source code to find functions that are responsible for creating the temporary files. 
# **Verify that sensitive data is not cached.** Examine the code that creates temporary files used by the application to make sure that sensitive data is not stored in these files.

==How to Fix==

To prevent caching of sensitive data:

# **Identify sensitive data.** Make a list of all sensitive information handled by your application. Some examples are:
#* Passwords
#* Encryption keys
#* Personal information
# **Identify code that creates temporary files used by the application.** Review the application source code to find functions that are responsible for creating the temporary files.  Find all such functions that write sensitive data.
# **Remove code that writes sensitive data to temporary files.** Edit any functions that write sensitive data to temporary files so that they do not write sensitive data.
