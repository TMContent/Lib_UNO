* iOS applications that send or receive sensitive data over the network.

==What to Check For==

Verify that SSL is used to protect network connections.

==Why==

Proper use of SSL to encrypt network communications prevents eavesdropping attacks and other types of man-in-the-middle attacks.

==How to Check==

To verify that SSL is used to protect network connections:

# **Identify all communications performed by the application.** Review the application design to identify all network communications that are performed by the application.
# **Review communication security requirements.** Examine which network communications need to be encrypted. All transmissions that include sensitive data, including authentication credentials and session IDs, should be encrypted. In some cases, it might be practical to encrypt all network connections.
# **Identify code that uses the network.** Identify code that is responsible for each network communication that needs to be encrypted.
# **Verify that SSL is used to protect network connections.** Examine code that is responsible for network connections that need to be encrypted and make sure that it uses SSL.

==How to Fix==

To use SSL to protect network connections:

# **Identify all communications performed by the application.** Review the application design to identify all network communications that are performed by the application.
# **Define communication security requirements.** Define which network communications need to be encrypted. All transmissions that include sensitive data should be encrypted. In some cases, it might be practical to encrypt all network connections.
# **Identify code that uses the network.** Identify code that is responsible for each network communication that needs to be encrypted.
# **Add code that uses SSL.** Rewrite code that performs sensitive network communications to use SSL. The //NSURLRequest// and //NSURLConnection// classes support SSL with an acceptably secure default configuration starting with iOS 5 - this is the most practical way to use SSL on iOS and should be sufficient for most applications.
