Use the IISCrypto tool to configure the TLS cypher suites used by IIS. 

==Why==

Choose strong TLS suites to avoid known vulnerabilities in TLS. Weak crypto suites are subject to crypto attacks which will decipher and compromise confidential data. 

==How==

Use the free //IISCrypto// tool to choose strong TLS cypher suites:

# **Download //IISCrypto//.** //IISCrypto// may be downloaded at the link at the bottom of this article. 
# **Run //IISCrypto//.** //IISCrypto// is easy to deploy and has a very simple interface. Download and run //IISCrypto//.
# **Chooose your desired compliance standard(s).** //IISCrypto// comes with presets based on common information security standards. Choose the ones that are the most applicable to your situation. In a couple of clicks, your IIS TLS cypher suites should be configured in compliance with the selected standards.
