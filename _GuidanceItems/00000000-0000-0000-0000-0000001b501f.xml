==What to Check For==
Check that the directive //Strict-Transport-Security       max-age=(time value)// is present in the HTTP Server Response.
 
==Why==
The Strict-Transport-Security header instructs the browser to communicate with the server only via HTTPS, a secure communication tunnel that prevents eavesdropping. Without the header, there is no way for the browser to “know” that a web page should be accessed over HTTPS. This leaves open the possibility of using standard, unencrypted HTTP, whether through a malicious link or direct URL access. 

==How To Check==
    #  **Check that the //mod_header// module is enabled in the //httpd.conf// file**. Find the //httpd.conf// file on your filesystem. This file is usually located in // /etc/httpd/httpd.conf// (consult your Web Server distribution documentation for the exact file location). Make sure that the line //LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so// appears in the file; this line enables //mod_header//. Apache Web servers must be compiled with support for //mod_header// for this to work.
    # **Check that the HSTS Header appears in the //httpd.conf// file**. View the //httpd.conf// file and make sure that the line //Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=7776000;includeSubDomains"// is present. This line enables HTTP Strict Transport Security.
    # **Reload or restart the Web Server configuration**. If you made changes to the //httpd.conf// file, stop and restart the Web server. For example, with Apache2, execute the command ///etc/init.d/apache2 stop// to stop the server and ///etc/init.d/apache2 start// to restart it.

==How To Fix==
Note that, as of this writing, the latest releases of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Opera all support the HSTS header. However, Internet Explorer does not.

# **Enable the //mod_header// module in the //httpd.conf// configuration file (if it is not already enabled).** For example, if you are using Apache Web Server, first enable
//LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so//
# **Add the HSTS header to the //httpd.conf// configuration file.** Include the required directive //max-age//. This specifies the time, in seconds, that a compliant browser will abide by forced HTTPS, even in the event a standard HTTP connection is attempted. For example, in the Apache //httpd.conf// configuration file, add the following line: //Header always append Strict-Transport-Security: "max-age=7776000"//. This directive instructs the browser to connect only via HTTPS for the next 90 days. The server will inject this header information into each application page rendered.
# **Reload or restart the web server configuration.** The first time the user connects to your website using HTTPS, the browser reads the HSTS header, including the //max-age// directive. The browser will know it should connect only via HTTPS for the specified //max-age// time period.
