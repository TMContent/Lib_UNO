  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Verify that the responsibilities of the staff assigned to the development environment&amp;nbsp;are separate from the responsibilities of the staff assigned to the production environment. Check that the development staff are not be working in the production environment
 and vice versa.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Keeping the staff responsibilities separate helps maintain the separation of the production and testing environments.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Interview the staff assigned to the production environment about their responsibilities. Interview the staff assigned to the development environment about their responsibilities. Compare the responsibilities of personnel assigned to development and production
 environments to determine if they are separate.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>If a development environment does not exist already, create it. If a development environment has been a part of the production environment, remove all development elements from the production environment. The development staff should be separate from the
 people working in the production environment.&amp;nbsp;The personnel working in the production environment should not be concerned with development tasks.</p>
