==What to Check For==

Verify that the origin attribute on WebSocket messages is checked before the messages are processed.

==Why==

If you do not check the origin of the MessageEvent to confirm that it is coming from a safe domain, your application may be open to attacks. These attacks may be in the form of messages sent from other servers and may contain messages harmful to your application.

==How To Check==

To verify that the origin attribute on messages is checked before the messages are processed:

# **Find code that processes messages from WebSockets.** Search the application code for functions that handle messages received from WebSockets. To find these functions, search for //onmessage// event handlers. Create a spreadsheet to list all code that receives messages from WebSockets.
# **Identify the allowed domains from which a message will be accepted**. Always use a white list approach. Gather a list of the valid domains and be as strict as possible. Include only the domains from which you want to process messages.
# **Verify that the message origin is validated before messages are handled.** Examine each piece of code that handles WebSocket messages. Make sure that the event origin is validated before data is processed using a white-list approach, so that only data from the explicitly authorized domains is processed.

==How To Fix==

The technique for checking the origin attribute depends on whether you would like to verify a specific server or a specific domain. 

# **If the origin is expected to be a specific server, check it against the server name.** Use the JavaScript === operator to verify equality between the expected server name and the value of the origin attribute. 
# **If the origin is expected to be from one or more domains, check it against the domain name(s).** Use a regular expression to provide wildcard-type functionality. To do so, continue with Steps 3-9 below.
# **Identify the allowed domains from which a message will be accepted.** Always use a white list approach. Gather a list of the valid domains and be as strict as possible. Include only the domains from which you want to process messages.
# **Create a function for validating the domains to centralize the logic.** Creating a function also allows you to test the code more easily.
# **Check the length of the domain before validating it.** Use the length property to ensure the size of the domain is not so large that it will cause a RegEx DoS. 
# **Build the regular expression for validating your domains.** The expression will look like this one, which tests valid host names using Internet Engineering Task Force Request for Comments 1035: {{{ ^https?:\/\/([a-z][-a-z0-9]+[a-z0-9]\.)*mydomain\.com$ }}}. This expression allows both HTTP and HTTP over Secure Sockets Layer (HTTPS). It white lists the allowed characters for a host name in a URL. The question mark [?] is a qualifier that matches the previous character(s) once at most. The expression ([a-z][-a-z0-9]+[a-z0-9]\.)* will match one or more host names, so {{{ http://myserver.example.com }}} as well as {{{ http://www.mysubdomain.example.com }}} will match.
# **Inside the new function, create a regular expression object with your expression.** Pass the expression to the RegExp constructor, as shown here: {{{ var re = new RegExp(/^https?:\/\/([a-z][-a-z0-9]+[a-z0-9]\.)*mydomain\.com$/); }}}
# **Use the test() method of the RegExp object to verify that the origin attribute matches.** The test() method can be used like this: {{{ return pattern.test(origin); }}}
# **Call the function from your onmessage event handler.** Pass the value of the origin attribute to your function: {{{ webSocket.onmessage = function(event) ... }}}
# **Test thoroughly.** Test the code thoroughly with both positive and negative matches to be sure that it properly handles the validation.
