    <Data><![CDATA[==Applies To==

* Android applications that offer file sharing.

==What to Do==

Disable file sharing by default in applications that offer file sharing.

==Why==

Disable file sharing to prevent unauthorized access. If file sharing is necessary, it should only be enabled when it is being used.

==How==

To disable file sharing by default.

# **Identify file sharing functionality.** Determine whether the application implements file sharing. If so, find the code that implements it.
# **Disable file sharing by default.** Edit the code that implements file sharing to disable file sharing by default. Provide controls to the user to enable file sharing when needed. Encrypt network connections used for file sharing. Protect file sharing with usernames and passwords and to allow the user to set the usernames and passwords that are allowed to access shared files.
