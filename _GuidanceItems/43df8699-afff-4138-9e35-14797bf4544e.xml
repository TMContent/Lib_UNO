  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 1.1.5.b</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Document the potentially insecure services.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Services that are known to be insecure should not be running unless they are absolutely necessary for business. Document the business need for any insecure services to make sure they are absolutely indispensable.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Identify all services that are required for business operations. Identify which services are known to be insecure. Replace the insecure services with secure ones if possible. Add mitigation measures if possible and document them. If it is not possible to
 replace or remove insecure services, document the business need for them and the nature of known vulnerabilities.</p>]]></Data>
