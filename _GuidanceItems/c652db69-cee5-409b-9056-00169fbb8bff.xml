# **Verify that file sharing is disabled by default.** Check the default settings to make sure that file sharing is disabled by default.

==How to Fix==

To disable file sharing by default.

# **Identify file sharing functionality.** Determine whether the application implements file sharing and if so, find the code that implements it.
# **Disable file sharing by default.** Edit the code that implements file sharing to disable file sharing by default. Provide controls to the user to enable file sharing when needed.
