    <Data><![CDATA[==Applies To==

* Android applications that send or receive sensitive data over the network.

==What to Check For==

Verify that self-signed TLS certificates are disabled.

==Why==

Allowing the use of self-signed TLS certificates enables some types of man-in-the-middle attacks.

==How to Check==

Self-signed TLS certificates are disabled on Android by default. To verify that self-signed TLS certificates are disabled:

# **Search for code that allows self-signed TLS certificates.** Search application code for the presence of the //setDefaultHostnameVerifier// method call - the presence of this method call indicates that self-signed TLS certificates may be allowed.
# **Verify that self-signed TLS certificates are not allowed in production releases.** If self-signed TLS certificates are allowed for development purposes, make sure that they are disabled in production releases. The recommended way to disable development code in production releases is by using //#define// and //#ifdef// compiler directives.

==How to Fix==

Self-signed TLS certificates are disabled on Android by default. Do not allow them in production releases.
