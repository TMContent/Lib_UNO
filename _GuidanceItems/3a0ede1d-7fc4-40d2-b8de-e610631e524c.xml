  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 8.2.4</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Change passwords at least every 90 days.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Changing passwords regularly ensures that if a password has been compromised, it will soon become useless.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Perform the following actions to assure that passwords are changed regularly in an Active Directory environment:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Launch the "Group Policy Management" console. </strong>The "Group Policy Management" console is included in Windows 2008, but has to be downloaded and installed on Windows 2003 and 2000. The link to the download is available at the bottom of this
 page. To launch the "Group Policy Management" console, execute the "gpmc.msc" command.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Edit or create a Group Policy Object (GPO).</strong> To create and activate a new Group Policy Object (GPO), launch "The Group Policy Management" console, right click on the domain and select "Create and Link a GPO Here." To edit an existing GPO,
 navigate to the "Group Policy Objects" folder under the current domain, right click on the GPO and select "Edit" - this will open the "Group Policy Object Editor." To change the settings of a GPO using the "Group Policy Object Editor, navigate the folders
 to find the setting of interest, double click on it, set the desired option(s).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Enable the "Maximum password age" policy.</strong> The "Maximum password age" policy is located under "Windows Settings", "Security Settings", "Account Policies", "Password Policy". Set the "Maximum password age" policy to 90 days or less.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
