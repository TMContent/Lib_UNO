  <ul>
    <li>PCI DSS Requirement 1.3.3</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>The cardholder data environment should not have direct Internet access. Neither outbound nor inbound traffic should be routable between the cardholder data environment and the Internet.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Denying the cardholder data environment Internet connectivity prevents the potential attacker from being able to conduct attacks against it.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Check the router and firewall configurations to make sure there are no port-forwarding rules or gateways that allow inbound connections directly to the cardholder data environment. Use built-in operating system tools (such as ping, traceroute, nslookup)
 to make sure that the cardholder data environment has no Internet access. </p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Remove any routes from the router configuration that allow Internet access to the cardholder data environment. Remove any port forwarding rules from the firewalls and/or routers that allow Internet access to the cardholder data environment. Repeat the How
 to Check processes to ensure that&amp;nbsp;changes have not accidentally introduced Internet connectivity in the cardholder environment.</p>
