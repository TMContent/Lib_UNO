  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>The Information Security policy should require the router configuration to be reviewed at least every six months. The results of each review should be included in the router documentation.</p>

  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Check the information security policy to make sure it includes a requirement for a review of the router configuration at least every six months. Check the network documentation to make sure it includes the results of the previous reviews.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Add a point to the information security policy to perform a review of the router configuration every six months. Designate staff responsible for performing the review of the router configuration. Add the results of each review to the network documentation.</p>
