    <Data><![CDATA[==Applies To==
* iOS applications that authenticate to a remote server.

==What to Check For==

Verify that authentication is implemented on the server-side.

==Why==

Server-side authentication should be used because client-side authentication is trivial to bypass.

==How to Check==

To verify that authentication is implemented server-side:

# **Review authentication requirements.** Consider the following aspects of authentication control as they pertain to your application:
#* Enforcing password strength requirements.
#* Allowing secure password reset or recovery.
#* Requiring re-authentication for sensitive operations.
#* Using multi-factor authentication.
#* Using simple error messages that don't give away information to the attacker.
#* Using TLS to secure communications.
#* Throttling repeated authentication attempts.
#* Locking inactive authentication accounts.
# **Identify authentication code.** Identify the code that is responsible for authentication both on the iOS device and on the remote server.
# **Review authentication code.** Examine authentication code to find where the actual security controls are implemented.
# **Verify that authentication is implemented on the server.** Make sure that sufficient security controls to satisfy authentication requirements are implemented server-side.


==How to Fix==

To implement authentication server-side:

# **Define authentication requirements.** Consider the following aspects of authentication controls as they pertain to your application:
#* Enforcing password strength requirements.
#* Allowing secure password reset or recovery.
#* Requiring re-authentication for sensitive operations.
#* Using multi-factor authentication.
#* Using simple error messages that don't give away information to the attacker.
#* Using TLS to secure communications.
#* Throttling repeated authentication attempts.
#* Locking inactive authentication accounts.
# **Implement authentication on the server.** It is important to implement security controls such as authentication on the server, because an attacker can easily tamper with client-side security controls or disable them altogether. Implement authentication controls that match the requirements defined in the previous step on the server back-end. 
# **Add client-side code that authenticates to the server.** Once authentication is implemented in accordance with the requirements, add client-side code that authenticates to the server. The client-side code will need:
#* An interface for managing authentication credentials.
#* Network code that communicates with the server using TLS. 
#* A token or some other means to maintain a session state on the server.  
#* Possibly, secure storage for cached authentication credentials.
