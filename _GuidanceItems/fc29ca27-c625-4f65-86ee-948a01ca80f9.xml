  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>The user's identity should be verified before performing a requested password reset.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>The user's identity should be verified before performing a requested password reset to ensure that an attacker is not pretending to be the user to gain access.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Review the password policy to make sure it requires that the user's identity is verified when a password reset is requested. Interview the responsible staff to make sure they verify the user's identity before resetting a password.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Add a requirement to the password policy to verify the user's identity when performing a requested password reset. Design and implement procedures for verifying the user's identity. For example, a userâ€™s identity may be verified by meeting in person.</p>
