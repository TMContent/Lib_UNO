  <h1>What to Do</h1>
  <p>Issue badges for visitors. Make the visitor badges easily distinguishable from employee badges. Collect visitor badges when visitors leave.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Visitors should be issued badges to show that their access has been authorized and to distinguish them from employees. Visitor badges should be different from employee badges so that a visitor cannot impersonate an employee. Visitors should turn in their
 badges so that they cannot return and gain unauthorized access.</p>
  <h1>How</h1>
  <p>Acquire a badge management system. A badge management system typically includes card-readers, a card-issuing device, and a card-management application. Deploy the badge management system by following the vendor's instructions. Design at least two types of
 badges, one to be issued to visitors and the other to be used by employees. </p>
  <p>Authorize visitors' access before issuing badges. Instruct visitors to display their badges prominently when inside the facility. Ask visitors to return their badges when they are leaving the facility.</p>]]></Data>
