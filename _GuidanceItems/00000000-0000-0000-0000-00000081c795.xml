* Android applications that authenticate to a remote server.

==What to Do==

Use server-side authentication.

==Why==

Server-side authentication should be used because client-side authentication is trivial to bypass.

==How==

# **Define authentication requirements.** Consider the following aspects of authentication control as they pertain to your application:
#* Enforcing password strength requirements.
#* Allowing secure password reset or recovery.
#* Requiring re-authentication for sensitive operations.
#* Using multi-factor authentication.
#* Using simple error messages that don't give away information to the attacker.
#* Using SSL/TLS to secure communications.
#* Throttling repeated authentication attempts.
#* Locking inactive authentication accounts.
# **Implement authentication on the server.** It is important to implement security controls such as authentication on the server, because an attacker can tamper with client-side security controls or disable them altogether. Implement authentication controls that match the requirements defined in the previous step on the server back-end. 
# **Add client-side code that authenticates to the server.** Once authentication is implemented in accordance with the requirements, add client-side code that authenticates to the server. The client-side code will need:
#* An interface for managing authentication credentials. 
#* Network code that communicates with the server using SSL/TLS. 
#* A token or some other means to maintain session state on the server, and possibly secure storage for cached authentication credentials.
