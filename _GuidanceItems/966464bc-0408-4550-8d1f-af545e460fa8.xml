  <h1>What to Check For</h1>
  <p>Strong cryptography should be used whenever cardholder data is being transmitted over open, public networks.</p>
  <h1>Why</h1>
  <p>Encrypt the cardholder data when transmitting to prevent it from being read if intercepted by an attacker.</p>
  <h1>How to Check</h1>
  <p>Identify if and how the cardholder data is transmitted over open, public networks, such as the Internet. Identify all the computers that are involved in the transmission. Make sure that a strong encryption solution is used on each involved computer to secure
 the transmission. Some acceptable network encryption solutions are IPsec and TLS.</p>
  <h1>How to Fix</h1>
  <p>Identify if and how the cardholder data is transmitted over open, public networks, such as the Internet. Identify all the computers that are involved in the transmission. Choose a strong encryption solution to secure the transmission. Some acceptable encryption
 solutions are IPsec and TLS: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>IPsec</strong> is best used with VPN. IPSec is only an option when all hosts involved have static IPs.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>TLS </strong>is best used for transmitting data between a web client and a web server.
</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Install and configure a strong encryption solution on each involved computer to secure the transmission.</p>
